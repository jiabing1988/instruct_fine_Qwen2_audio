'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out. and um. yeah that. that's uh something i have to work on. like exercising or something. um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about. um. he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage. on him. uh really tired of talking about that same topic. um. well it came it spawned from <f> from. a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for. many things. and um <clears throat>. and so he took that information and came home. and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me. think about cheating and. he knows that i've been resentful of him. and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating. <clears throat> and um <sigh>. i we've had this conversation a lot of times. and uh i mean not just that but. i don't know just about cheating in general. and um so i just said what i. normally said normally say is that i haven't. um. cheated and that i. did think about that when we were first together. and uh but it was just a mere thought. and. um. and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another. and that just kinda. <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that. and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again. and why are we having this conversation <laughter>. are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that. that. went into. that um. argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting. um <sigh>. not talking. at all <laughter>. um <sigh>. mm. pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled. because i really don't like. if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because. um i was yelled at. a lot. and i just. feel bad about that and i. try really hard to not. handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get. and result in in yelling. hmm. that would probably be whether to keep. a pregnancy or not. yeah. yeah i um. i was just talking about it yesterday actually. and um. oh i was pregnant and. i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married. and but i just. didn't think that i it was the right time for me. and um. i had. pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy. but i made the decision by myself. and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant. he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me. and so that decision was quite hard. because i felt obligated to do so. and felt super guilty to not. and. <drops microphone> oops. and uh. this is on correctly um. hang on this ear piece is falling. there we go. that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no. i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make. in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um. the hospital should um unplug the life. or um life support machine for my father. or not. that was the hardest decision. um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that. and to have been um. to resort to the situation that he was in. not capable of doing anything at all either speaking. for himself um. was beyond it. who he was and i just couldn't see him. like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told. so i agreed. to um resort that. not. hardly ever. <laughter>. too many things running on my mind um. and pretty much um. mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends. uh even though i. know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about. uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time. but um. and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out. but it's hard. very stressed. mm my son is is um. has been. uh in dealing with some legal issues. and um currently is incarcerated. and uh. it's been really hard. yes i've been probably very short. moody irritable. well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter>. my mind just goes from one. point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there. um you know. it's interesting. uh yeah. no. yes. about three years ago. um my. um o_b_g. suggested i. i uh. see a psychiatrist. yes. well um. i've. in the process of changing therapists so it's been about. because the program that i was in. um. lost funding. and i lost my therapist. or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been. about two months. maybe three now. and um but i did notice when i was in therapy. um that it was just an intricate part of my. my life my week to. see my therapist. um. it really helped me. cope. um. <sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um. when he was released. from um. jail. um. a go getter uh probably you

um. outgoing. um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her. um. and. compassionate. sensitive. loyal. mm. all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter>. well yelling the yelling part was one. um. just <j> just the little things that. used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself. doing them and it bothers me a lot. regarding what. mm. <clears throat>. um. not too much really i don't know. <clears throat>. to go to college right after high school. and not wait. um. and <sigh>. that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy. or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and. not in a relationship and still be happy and. live life. um. what did i do. mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really

<f> from. a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for. many things. and um <clears throat>. and so he took that information and came home. and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me. think about cheating and. he knows that i've been resentful of him. and did that make me

just about cheating in general. and um so i just said what i. normally said normally say is that i haven't. um. cheated and that i. did think about that when we were first together. and uh but it was just a mere thought. and. um. and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another. and that just kinda. <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered

'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out. and um. yeah that. that's uh something i have to work on. like exercising or something. um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about. um. he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage. on him. uh really tired of talking about that same topic. um. well it came it spawned from <f> from. a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for. many things. and um <clears throat>. and so he took that information and came home. and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me. think about cheating and. he knows that i've been resentful of him. and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating. <clears throat> and um <sigh>. i we've had this conversation a lot of times. and uh i mean not just that but. i don't know just about cheating in general. and um so i just said what i. normally said normally say is that i haven't. um. cheated and that i. did think about that when we were first together. and uh but it was just a mere thought. and. um. and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another. and that just kinda. <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that. and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again. and why are we having this conversation <laughter>. are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that. that. went into. that um. argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting. um <sigh>. not talking. at all <laughter>. um <sigh>. mm. pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled. because i really don't like. if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because. um i was yelled at. a lot. and i just. feel bad about that and i. try really hard to not. handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get. and result in in yelling. hmm. that would probably be whether

just. didn't think that i it was the right time for me. and um. i had. pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy. but i made the decision by myself. and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant. he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me. and so that decision was quite hard. because i felt obligated to do so. and felt super guilty to not. and. <drops microphone> oops. and uh. this is on correctly um. hang on this ear piece is falling. there we go. that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no. i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make. in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um. the hospital should um unplug the life. or um life support machine for my father. or not. that was the hardest decision. um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that. and to have been um. to resort to the situation that he was in. not capable of doing anything at all either speaking. for himself um. was beyond it. who he was and i just couldn't see him. like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told. so i agreed. to um resort that. not. hardly ever. <laughter>. too many things running on my mind um. and pretty much um. mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with

'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out. and um. yeah that. that's uh something i have to work on. like exercising or something. um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about. um. he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage. on him. uh really tired of talking about that same topic. um. well it came it spawned from <f> from. a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for. many things. and um <clears throat>. and so he took that information and came home. and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me. think about cheating and. he knows that i've been resentful of him. and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating. <clears throat> and um <sigh>. i we've had this conversation a lot of times. and uh i mean not just that but. i don't know just about cheating in general. and um so i just said what i. normally said normally say is that i haven't. um. cheated and that i. did think about that when we were first together. and uh but it was just a mere thought. and. um. and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another. and that just kinda. <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that. and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again. and why are we having this conversation <laughter>. are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that. that. went into. that um. argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting. um <sigh>. not talking. at all <laughter>. um <sigh>. mm. pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled. because i really don't like. if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because. um i was yelled at. a lot. and i just. feel bad about that and i. try really hard to not. handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get. and result in in yelling. hmm. that would probably be whether to keep. a pregnancy or not. yeah. yeah i um. i was just talking about it yesterday actually. and um. oh i was pregnant and. i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married. and but i just. didn't think that i it was the right time for me. and um. i had. pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy. but i made the decision by myself. and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant. he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me. and so that decision was quite hard. because i felt obligated to do so. and felt super guilty to not. and. <drops microphone> oops. and uh. this is on correctly um. hang on this ear piece is falling. there we go. that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no. i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make. in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um. the hospital should um unplug the life. or um life support machine for my father. or not. that was the hardest decision. um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that. and to have been um. to resort to the situation that he was in. not capable of doing anything at all either speaking. for himself um. was beyond it. who he was and i just couldn't see him. like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told. so i agreed. to um resort that. not. hardly ever. <laughter>. too many things running on my mind um. and pretty much um. mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends. uh even though i. know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about. uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time. but um. and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out. but it's hard. very stressed. mm my son is is um. has been. uh in dealing with some legal issues. and um currently is incarcerated. and uh. it's been really hard. yes i've been probably very short. moody irritable. well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter>. my mind just goes from one. point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there. um you know. it's interesting. uh yeah. no. yes. about three years ago. um my. um o_b_g. suggested i. i uh. see a psychiatrist. yes. well um. i've. in the process of changing therapists so it's been about. because the program that i was in. um. lost funding. and i lost my therapist. or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been. about two months. maybe three now. and um but i did notice when i was in therapy. um that it was just an intricate part of my. my life my week to. see my therapist. um. it really helped me. cope. um. <sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um. when he was released. from um. jail. um. a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning. that i'll. i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to. do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know. legally of course. um. outgoing. um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her. um. and. compassionate. sensitive. loyal. mm. all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter>. well yelling the yelling part was one. um. just <j> just the little things that. used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself. doing them and it bothers me a lot. regarding what. mm. <clears throat>. um. not too much really i don't know. <clears throat>. to go to college right after high school. and not wait. um. and <sigh>. that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy. or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and. not in a relationship and still be happy and. live life. um. what did i do. mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really

'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out. and um. yeah that. that's uh something i have to work on. like exercising or something. um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about. um. he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage. on him. uh really tired of talking about that same topic. um. well it came it spawned from <f> from. a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for. many things. and um <clears throat>. and so he took that information and came home. and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me. think about cheating and. he knows that i've been resentful of him. and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating. <clears throat> and um <sigh>. i we've had this conversation a lot of times. and uh i mean not just that but. i don't know just about cheating in general. and um so i just said what i. normally said normally say is that i haven't. um. cheated and that i. did think about that when we were first together. and uh but it was just a mere thought. and. um. and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another. and that just kinda. <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that. and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again. and why are we having this conversation <laughter>. are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that. that. went into. that um. argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting. um <sigh>. not talking. at all <laughter>. um <sigh>. mm. pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled. because i really don't like. if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because. um i was yelled at. a lot. and i just. feel bad about that and i. try really hard to not. handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get. and result in in yelling. hmm. that would probably be whether to keep. a pregnancy or not. yeah. yeah i um. i was just talking about it yesterday actually. and um. oh i was pregnant and. i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married. and but i just. didn't think that i it was the right time for me. and um. i had. pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy. but i made the decision by myself. and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant. he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me. and so that decision was quite hard. because i felt obligated to do so. and felt super guilty to not. and. <drops microphone> oops. and uh. this is on correctly um. hang on this ear piece is falling. there we go. that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no. i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make. in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um. the hospital should um unplug the life. or um life support machine for my father. or not. that was the hardest decision. um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that. and to have been um. to resort to the situation that he was in. not capable of doing anything at all either speaking. for himself um. was beyond it. who he was and i just couldn't see him. like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told. so i agreed. to um resort that. not. hardly ever. <laughter>. too many things running on my mind um. and pretty much um. mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends. uh even though i. know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about. uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time. but um. and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out. but it's hard. very stressed. mm my son is is um. has been. uh in dealing with some legal issues. and um currently is incarcerated. and uh. it's been really hard. yes i've been probably very short. moody irritable. well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter>. my mind just goes from one. point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there. um you know. it's interesting. uh yeah. no. yes. about three years ago. um my. um o_b_g. suggested i. i uh. see a psychiatrist. yes. well um. i've. in the process of changing therapists so it's been about. because the program that i was in. um. lost funding. and i lost my therapist. or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been. about two months. maybe three now. and um but i did notice when i was in therapy. um that it was just an intricate part of my. my life my week to. see my therapist. um. it really helped me. cope. um. <sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um. when he was released. from um. jail. um. a go getter uh probably you

'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room. and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of. we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move . it's okay it'll get better. it depends with whom . i'm. dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good. but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger. oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter]. yeah. uh probably my best friend nicole. she's probably been we've been best friends for like. god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah. um. of. of what . uh my friend nicole. um we met in french class freshman year of high school. we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then. mhm. um. uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking. staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography. um. just hanging out with friends i guess. whatever. uh. it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um. those kinds of. things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things.  i don't really discuss that with them. so i guess superficially close. but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess. mhm. uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again. i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant. and. uh. conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um. what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter]. but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess. uh yesterday. and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money . and so and. so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy. and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through. about other people or about myself or angry. xxxx [laughter]. um. angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often. dang it. that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me. um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring. so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um.  my dream job. i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end. i guess it's something that i realized. i like to see. the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so. something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography. i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something. in that. realm i guess. i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to. gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries. i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that. i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome. um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot. in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and. see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to. stir things up. oh gosh okay um. i'm trying to think. one of my trips. i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is. one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon. i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places. i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so. um. and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made. and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like. white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful. or something that's different too. cool. um. pretty easy as long as I. get well no i always sleep so easy. oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world. i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of . energizing me so no it's not too bad. that's good. uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in. so. it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing. yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for. so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck. barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like. when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know. yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so. but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh. all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so. uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]. yes. but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because. i'm just trying to find like what. i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries. so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation. it's all good. uh no i don't think so but i mean. i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can. but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds. nope. nope. oh let's see. uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail. 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home. so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it. so. ten years ago. well that would've made me like twelve so.  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act. i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time. and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it. and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes . um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just. expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder. kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good. i don't try to go above that. if that makes any sense. uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v. [laughter]. but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap. or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done. so. [laughter]. that's a tough question. um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college. um. i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east. and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year. and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont. and um. i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in. and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing . um. but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like. um. just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well. and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not. um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy. that's probably one. yeah. it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter]. yeah. bubbly . fun . maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um. probably .  uh definitely friendly. um and pretty like a positive person. um. but sometimes maybe a little bit. aggressive but. for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter]. huh . really happy. oh when i was in mexico. over winter well. no i don't know. my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in . san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun. that was a good time. yeah it was cool. [laughter] bye.",

'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room. and the other one is always working late so we just our our

um. pretty easy as long as I. get well no i always sleep so easy. oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world. i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of . energizing me so no it's not too bad. that's good. uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in. so. it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing. yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for. so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck. barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like. when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know. yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so. but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh. all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so. uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]. yes. but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because. i'm just trying to find like what. i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries. so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation. it's all good. uh no i don't think so but i mean. i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can. but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds. nope. nope. oh let's see. uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail. 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home. so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it. so. ten years ago. well that would've made me like twelve so.  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act. i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time. and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it. and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes . um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just. expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder. kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good. i don't try to go above that. if that makes any sense. uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v. [laughter]. but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap. or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done. so. [laughter]. that's a tough question. um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college. um. i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east. and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year. and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont. and um. i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in. and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing . um. but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like. um. just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well. and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not. um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy. that's probably one. yeah. it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter]. yeah. bubbly . fun . maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um. probably .  uh definitely friendly. um and pretty like a positive person. um. but sometimes maybe a little bit. aggressive but. for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter]. huh . really happy. oh when i was in mexico. over winter well. no i don't know. my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in . san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun. that was a good time. yeah it was cool.

'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room. and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of. we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move . it's okay it'll get better. it depends with whom . i'm. dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good. but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger. oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter]. yeah. uh probably my best friend nicole. she's probably been we've been best friends for like. god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah. um. of. of what . uh my friend nicole. um we met in french class freshman year of high school. we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then. mhm. um. uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking. staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography. um. just hanging out with friends i guess. whatever. uh. it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um. those kinds of. things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things.  i don't really discuss that with them. so i guess superficially close. but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess. mhm. uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again. i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant. and. uh. conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um. what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter]. but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess. uh yesterday. and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money . and so and. so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy. and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through. about other people or about myself or angry. xxxx [laughter]. um. angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often. dang it. that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me. um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring. so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um.  my dream job. i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end. i guess it's something that i realized. i like to see. the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so. something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography. i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something. in that. realm i guess. i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to. gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries. i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that. i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome. um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot. in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and. see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to. stir things up. oh gosh okay um. i'm trying to think. one of my trips. i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is. one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon. i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places. i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so. um. and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made. and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like. white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful. or something that's different too. cool.

[laughter]. that's a tough question. um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college. um. i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east. and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year. and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont. and um. i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in. and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing . um. but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like. um. just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well. and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not. um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy. that's probably one. yeah. it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter]. yeah. bubbly . fun . maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um. probably .  uh definitely friendly. um and pretty like a positive person. um. but sometimes maybe a little bit. aggressive but. for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter]. huh . really happy. oh when i was in mexico. over winter well. no i don't know. my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in . san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun. that was a good time. yeah it was cool.

'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room. and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of. we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move . it's okay it'll get better. it depends with whom . i'm. dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good. but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger. oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter]. yeah. uh probably my best friend nicole. she's probably been we've been best friends for like. god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah. um. of. of what . uh my friend nicole. um we met in french class freshman year of high school. we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then. mhm. um. uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking. staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography. um. just hanging out with friends i guess. whatever. uh. it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um. those kinds of. things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things.  i don't really discuss that with them. so i guess superficially close. but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess. mhm. uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again. i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant. and. uh. conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um. what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter]. but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess. uh yesterday. and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money . and so and. so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy. and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through. about other people or about myself or angry. xxxx [laughter]. um. angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often. dang it. that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me. um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring. so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um.  my dream job. i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end. i guess it's something that i realized. i like to see. the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so. something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography. i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something. in that. realm i guess. i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to. gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries. i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that. i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome. um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot. in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and. see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to. stir things up. oh gosh okay um. i'm trying to think. one of my trips. i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is. one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon. i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places. i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so. um. and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made. and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like. white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful. or something that's different too. cool. um. pretty easy as long as I. get well no i always sleep so easy. oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world. i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of . energizing me so no it's not too bad. that's good. uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in. so. it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing. yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for. so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck. barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like. when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know. yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so. but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh. all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so. uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]. yes. but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because. i'm just trying to find like what. i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries. so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation. it's all good. uh no i don't think so but i mean. i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can. but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds. nope. nope. oh let's see. uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail. 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home. so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it. so. ten years ago. well that would've made me like twelve so.  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act. i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time. and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it. and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes . um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just. expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder. kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good. i don't try to go above that. if that makes any sense. uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v.

we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then. mhm. um. uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking. staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography. um. just hanging out with friends i guess. whatever. uh. it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um. those kinds of. things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things.  i don't really discuss that with them. so i guess superficially close. but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess. mhm. uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again. i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant. and. uh. conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um. what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter]. but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess. uh yesterday. and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money . and so and. so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy. and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through. about other people or about myself or angry. xxxx [laughter]. um. angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often. dang it. that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me. um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring. so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um.  my dream job. i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end. i guess it's something that i realized. i like to see. the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so. something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography. i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something. in that. realm i guess. i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to. gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries. i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that. i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome. um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot. in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and. see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to. stir things up. oh gosh okay um. i'm trying to think. one of my trips. i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is. one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon. i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places. i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so. um. and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made. and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like. white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful. or something that's different too. cool. um. pretty easy as long as I. get well no i always sleep so easy. oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world. i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of . energizing me so no it's not too bad. that's good. uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in. so. it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing. yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for. so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck. barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like. when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know. yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so. but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh. all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so. uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]. yes. but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because. i'm just trying to find like what. i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries. so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation. it's all good. uh no i don't think so but i mean. i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can. but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds. nope. nope. oh let's see. uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail. 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home. so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it. so. ten years ago. well that would've made me like twelve so.  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act. i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time. and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it. and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes . um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just. expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder. kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good. i don't try to go above that. if that makes any sense. uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v. [laughter]. but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap. or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done. so. [laughter]. that's a tough question. um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college. um. i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east. and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year. and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont. and um. i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in. and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing . um. but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like. um. just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well. and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not. um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy. that's probably one. yeah. it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter]. yeah. bubbly . fun . maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um. probably .  uh definitely friendly. um and pretty like a positive person. um. but sometimes maybe a little bit. aggressive but. for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter]. huh . really happy. oh when i was in mexico. over winter well. no i don't know. my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in . san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun. that was a good time. yeah it was cool.

'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room. and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of. we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move . it's okay it'll get better. it depends with whom . i'm. dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good. but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger. oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter]. yeah. uh probably my best

doing da da da that kind of thing. yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for. so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck. barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like. when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know. yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so. but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh. all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so. uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]. yes. but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because. i'm just trying to find like what. i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries. so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation. it's all good. uh no i don't think so but i mean. i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can. but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds. nope. nope. oh let's see. uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail. 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home. so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it. so. ten years ago. well that would've made me like twelve so.  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act. i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time. and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it. and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes . um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just. expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder. kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good. i don't try to go above that. if that makes any sense. uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v. [laughter]. but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap. or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done. so. [laughter]. that's a tough question. um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college. um. i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east. and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year. and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont. and um. i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in. and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing . um. but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like. um. just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well. and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not. um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy. that's probably one. yeah. it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter]. yeah. bubbly . fun . maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um. probably .  uh definitely friendly. um and pretty like a positive person. um. but sometimes maybe a little bit. aggressive but. for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter]. huh . really happy. oh when i was in mexico. over winter well. no i don't know. my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in . san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun. that was a good time. yeah it was cool.

little. pensive i guess a little. uh down but. more or less okay. i was born in annapolis maryland. on the east coast. originally i moved because i went to film school um. and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again. it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um. but living. l_a is very has a very different kind of. um. attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i. but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here. uh not at all um. when i left things got things were sort of i. i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um. to be with. uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of. i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of. not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. it's not easy it's. it's kind of um. i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job. um i miss um some friends um. i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot. um i feel like i failed. and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard. depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable. um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy. so that doesn't really answer your question but. um [clears throat]. i have certain. i do i do a lot of writing. um i have certain. music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can. when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of. happening really um. it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess. um. a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel. and when i was really. when i was really getting into writing it and um. it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed. um. it was about a. guy who is searching for. something it's. it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he. that he. met and just. was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because. sort of uh it's sort of romantic. adventure comedy kind of thing. well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting. um so i wrote some screenplays and uh. you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer. just creative writing so. i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to. to really hit me. it's not easy the [exhale]. the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um. i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i. hate it because it's so difficult. um. but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good. good i don't i don't really have a temper i. it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can. lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much. try to it when i'm upset. i i get upset with myself not with other people. um. last night i guess well <weh> um. i got in an argument about whether or not. cleaning vegetables was necessary because of. i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay. so it turned into this. big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i. i ended up being wrong on that one but. it is. yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. um. uh. a lot so much um. uh. i. i. i was in uh a relationship that i really really. um. that i really wanted to work. and. uh. i ended up and it was partly due to. i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going. at like everything sort of spiraled out of. control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't. i wasn't mean but i was. but i was getting more and more messed up. and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not. and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. so. that was pretty that was pretty tough. well some of it was was that. i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's. completely kind of i mean i still get. i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not. i don't completely lose it for days at a time. um. so. i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then. i would've i would i would be. i would be. it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have. i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different. things being how they were. i mean it's. it's possible uh. i mean obviously. yeah because i mean that's what i do i i. take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until. until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff. um. and it's like any little detail that comes up. i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still. i still get. i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school. which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there. well it's it's not. easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by. by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. um well like i said i do a lot of. you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost. be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be. you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just. keep my mind occupied during all of that. um. i just need i mean. i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet. they're triggered by everything. pretty much anything that i that i see if i. if i. if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about. just. anything you know i can reach back and connect. to. to this it's really it's really. i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break. from it. yeah. um. i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i. awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally. you know don't. i don't know i never really needed much sleep so. it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly. you know i get up i toss and turn all night. you know and now. it's just. it's. yeah i don't sleep too great right now. um. pretty i mean. i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i. i usually just kind of power through it and just. i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel. bad. um. i think. about three three four years ago. um. it was when i. i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for. for. years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got. this. situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like. even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so. so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately. it happened after everything uh went bad so. i don't know. in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel. it really makes me. angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm. that i had to that i i lost everything because. because of. chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control. and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't. it was it didn't help it didn't work until. until. you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but. it was a little it's a little late now. um. there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was. it was either. i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different. but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after. after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. but it was at least. that and not. firing me. but but but yeah but so i got help but it was. but it wasn't soon enough. uh not. not as much as i should. um. i go to a couple of. meetings. i go to i go to a_a so that i can. um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. um unfortunately you know being unemployed. my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so. you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing. somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really. very. i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so. it's basically to keep my medication coming. and then there's you <laughter>. right. well like i said i mean. just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now. um just saying stuff outloud is just. like getting getting this stuff out. trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. that you can actually deal with. is a big step like. regardless of who. you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that. stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can. talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. yeah. um. you know better than i than i have been um i mean. it it sort of. it goes <g> it has its ups and downs. um you know i'm applying for jobs. five six jobs. or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview. never even getting close to. to to being self sufficient again. um. it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control. so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is. it just has its it's just its own own challenge. yeah. um. it was probably you know a couple years ago. um. i i was. i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. uh. is. everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close. we were having fun together. and we went out and got a christmas tree. and. we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just. feeling like a part of somebody's life. and feeling like a part of the bigger. the bigger life. that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. you know for that instant i felt like. a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and. you know everything was going really well and. i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person. a normal happy person. and. part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. i don't know if i'll ever feel that again. so. um. probably the. probably this. educational <educary> educational series i did uh. an educational. uh video series i did for the national science foundation. um. it was. it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and. you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um. and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to. the world. oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um. it was it was a. we were trying to come up with. with new ideas uh. for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know. to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big. you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um. and there was a lot to it and so. it was probably the biggest. project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. right that doesn't yeah. um. i guess. <grunt>. i don't know <laughter> uh. i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i. i i i don't know. thank you.",

lot more shy. so that doesn't really answer your question but. um [clears throat]. i have certain. i do i do a lot of writing. um i have certain. music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can. when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of. happening really um. it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess. um. a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel. and when i was really. when i was really getting into writing it and um. it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed. um. it was about a. guy who is searching for. something it's. it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he. that he. met and just. was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because. sort of uh it's sort of romantic. adventure comedy kind of thing. well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting. um so i wrote some screenplays and uh. you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer. just creative writing so. i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to. to really hit me. it's not easy the [exhale]. the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um. i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i. hate it because it's so difficult. um. but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good. good i don't i don't really have a temper i. it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can. lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much. try to it when i'm upset. i i get upset with myself not with other people. um. last night i guess well <weh> um. i got in an argument about whether or not. cleaning vegetables was necessary because of. i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay. so it turned into this. big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i. i ended up being wrong on that one but. it is. yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. um. uh. a lot so much um. uh. i. i. i was in uh a relationship that i really really. um. that i really wanted to work. and. uh. i ended up and it was partly due to. i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going. at like everything sort of spiraled out of. control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't. i wasn't mean but i was. but i was getting more and more messed up. and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not. and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. so. that was pretty that was pretty tough. well some of it was was that. i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's. completely kind of i mean i still get. i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not. i don't completely lose it for days at a time. um. so. i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then. i would've i would i would be. i would be. it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have. i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different. things being how they were. i mean it's. it's possible uh. i mean obviously. yeah because i mean that's what i do i i. take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until. until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff. um. and it's like any little detail that comes up. i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still. i still get. i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school. which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there. well it's it's not. easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by. by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. um well like i said i do a lot of. you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost. be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be. you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just. keep my mind occupied during all of that. um. i just need i mean. i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet. they're triggered by everything. pretty much anything that i that i see if i. if i. if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about. just. anything you know i can reach back and connect. to. to this it's really it's really. i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break. from it. yeah. um. i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i. awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally. you know don't. i don't know i never really needed much sleep so. it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly. you know i get up i toss and turn all night. you know and now. it's just. it's. yeah i don't sleep too great right now. um. pretty i mean. i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i. i usually just kind of power through it and just. i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel. bad. um. i think. about three three four years ago. um. it was when i. i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for. for. years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got. this. situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like. even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so. so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately. it happened after everything uh went bad so. i don't know. in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel. it really makes me. angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm. that i had to that i i lost everything because. because of. chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control. and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't. it was it didn't help it didn't work until. until. you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but. it was a little it's a little late now. um. there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was. it was either. i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different. but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after. after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. but it was at least. that and not. firing me. but but but yeah but so i got help but it was. but it wasn't soon enough. uh not. not as much as i should. um. i go to a couple of. meetings. i go to i go to a_a so that i can. um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. um unfortunately you know being unemployed. my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so. you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing. somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really. very. i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so. it's basically to keep my medication coming. and then there's you <laughter>. right. well like i said i mean. just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now. um just saying stuff outloud is just. like getting getting this stuff out. trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. that you can actually deal with. is a big step like. regardless of who. you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that. stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can. talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. yeah. um. you know better than i than i have been um i mean. it it sort of. it goes <g> it has its ups and downs. um you know i'm applying for jobs. five six jobs. or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview. never even getting close to. to to being self sufficient again. um. it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control. so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is. it just has its it's just its own own challenge. yeah. um. it was probably you know a couple years ago. um. i i was. i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. uh. is. everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close. we were having fun together. and we went out and got a christmas tree. and. we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just. feeling like a part of somebody's life. and feeling like a part of the bigger. the bigger life. that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. you know for that instant i felt like. a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and. you know everything was going really well and. i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person. a normal happy person. and. part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. i don't know if i'll ever feel that again. so. um. probably the. probably this. educational <educary> educational series i did uh. an educational. uh video series i did for the national science foundation. um. it was. it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and. you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um. and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to. the world. oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um. it was it was a. we were trying to come up with. with new ideas uh. for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know. to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big. you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um. and there was a lot to it and so. it was probably the biggest. project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. right that doesn't yeah. um. i guess. <grunt>. i don't know <laughter> uh. i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i. i i i don't know. thank you.",

feet so it's it's it's hard. depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable. um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy. so that doesn't really answer your question but. um [clears throat]. i have certain. i do i do a lot of writing. um i have certain. music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can. when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of. happening really um. it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess. um. a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel. and when i was really. when i was really getting into writing it and um. it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed. um. it was about a. guy who is searching for. something it's. it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he. that he. met and just. was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because. sort of uh it's sort of romantic. adventure comedy kind of thing. well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting. um so i wrote some screenplays and uh. you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer. just creative writing so. i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to. to really hit me. it's not easy the [exhale]. the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um. i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i. hate it because it's so difficult. um. but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good. good i don't i don't really have a temper i. it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can. lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much. try to it when i'm upset. i i get upset with myself not with other people. um. last night i guess well <weh> um. i got in an argument about whether or not. cleaning vegetables was necessary because of. i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay. so it turned into this. big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i. i ended up being wrong on that one but. it is. yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. um. uh. a lot so much um. uh. i. i. i was in uh a relationship that i really really. um. that i really wanted to work. and. uh. i ended up and it was partly due to. i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going. at like everything sort of spiraled out of. control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't. i wasn't mean but i was. but i was getting more and more messed up. and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not. and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. so. that was pretty that was pretty tough. well some of it was was that. i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's. completely kind of i mean i still get. i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not. i don't completely lose it for days at a time. um. so. i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then. i would've i would i would be. i would be. it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have. i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different. things being how they were. i mean it's. it's possible uh. i mean obviously. yeah because i mean that's what i do i i. take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until. until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff. um. and it's like any little detail that comes up. i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still. i still get. i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school. which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there. well it's it's not. easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by. by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. um well like i said i do a lot of. you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost. be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be. you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just. keep my mind occupied during all of that. um. i just need i mean. i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet. they're triggered by everything. pretty much anything that i that i see if i. if i. if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about. just. anything you know i can reach back and connect. to. to this it's really it's really. i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break. from it. yeah. um. i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i. awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally. you know don't. i don't know i never really needed much sleep so. it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly. you know i get up i toss and turn all night. you know and now. it's just. it's. yeah i don't sleep too great right now. um. pretty i mean. i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i. i usually just kind of power through it and just. i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel. bad. um. i think. about three three four years ago. um. it was when i. i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for. for. years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got. this. situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like. even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so. so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately. it happened after everything uh went bad so. i don't know. in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel. it really makes me. angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm. that i had to that i i lost everything because. because of. chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control. and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't. it was it didn't help it didn't work until. until. you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but. it was a little it's a little late now. um. there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was. it was either. i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different. but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after. after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. but it was at least. that and not. firing me. but but but yeah but so i got help but it was. but it wasn't soon enough. uh not. not as much as i should. um. i go to a couple of. meetings. i go to i go to a_a so that i can. um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. um unfortunately you know being unemployed. my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so. you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing. somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really. very. i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so. it's basically to keep my medication coming. and then there's you <laughter>. right. well like i said i mean. just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now. um just saying stuff outloud is just. like getting getting this stuff out. trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. that you can actually deal with. is a big step like. regardless of who. you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that. stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can. talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. yeah. um. you know better than i than i have been um i mean. it it sort of. it goes <g> it has its ups and downs. um you know i'm applying for jobs. five six jobs. or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview. never even getting close to. to to being self sufficient again. um. it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control. so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is. it just has its it's just its own own challenge. yeah. um. it was probably you know a couple years ago. um. i i was. i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. uh. is. everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close. we were having fun together. and we went out and got a christmas tree. and. we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just. feeling like a part of somebody's life. and feeling like a part of the bigger. the bigger life. that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. you know for that instant i felt like. a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and. you know everything was going really well and. i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person. a normal happy person. and. part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. i don't know if i'll ever feel that again. so. um. probably the. probably this. educational <educary> educational series i did uh. an educational. uh video series i did for the national science foundation. um. it was. it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and. you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um. and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to. the world. oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um. it was it was a. we were trying to come up with. with new ideas uh. for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know. to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big. you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um. and there was a lot to it and so. it was probably the biggest. project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. right that doesn't yeah. um. i guess. <grunt>. i don't know <laughter> uh. i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i. i i i don't know. thank you.",

friends um. i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot. um i feel like i failed. and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard. depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable. um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy. so that doesn't really answer your question but. um [clears throat]. i have certain. i do i do a lot of writing. um i have certain. music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can. when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of. happening really um. it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess. um. a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel. and when i was really. when i was really getting into writing it and um. it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed. um. it was about a. guy who is searching for. something it's. it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he. that he. met and just. was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because. sort of uh it's sort of romantic. adventure comedy kind of thing. well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting. um so i wrote some screenplays and uh. you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer. just creative writing so. i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to. to really hit me. it's not easy the [exhale]. the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um. i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i. hate it because it's so difficult. um. but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good. good i don't i don't really have a temper i. it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can. lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much. try to it when i'm upset. i i get upset with myself not with other people. um. last night i guess well <weh> um. i got in an argument about whether or not. cleaning vegetables was necessary because of. i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay. so it turned into this. big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i. i ended up being wrong on that one but. it is. yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. um. uh. a lot so much um. uh. i. i. i was in uh a relationship that i really really. um. that i really wanted to work. and. uh. i ended up and it was partly due to. i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going. at like everything sort of spiraled out of. control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't. i wasn't mean but i was. but i was getting more and more messed up. and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not. and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. so. that was pretty that was pretty tough. well some of it was was that. i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's. completely kind of i mean i still get. i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not. i don't completely lose it for days at a time. um. so. i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then. i would've i would i would be. i would be. it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have. i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different. things being how they were. i mean it's. it's possible uh. i mean obviously. yeah because i mean that's what i do i i. take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until. until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff. um. and it's like any little detail that comes up. i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still. i still get. i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school. which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there. well it's it's not. easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by. by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. um well like i said i do a lot of. you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost. be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be. you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just. keep my mind occupied during all of that. um. i just need i mean. i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet. they're triggered by everything. pretty much anything that i that i see if i. if i. if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about. just. anything you know i can reach back and connect. to. to this it's really it's really. i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break. from it. yeah. um. i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i. awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally. you know don't. i don't know i never really needed much sleep so. it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly. you know i get up i toss and turn all night. you know and now. it's just. it's. yeah i don't sleep too great right now. um. pretty i mean. i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i. i usually just kind of power through it and just. i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel. bad. um. i think. about three three four years ago. um. it was when i. i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for. for. years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got. this. situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like. even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so. so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately. it happened after everything uh went bad so. i don't know. in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel. it really makes me. angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm. that i had to that i i lost everything because. because of. chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control. and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't. it was it didn't help it didn't work until. until. you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but. it was a little it's a little late now. um. there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was. it was either. i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different. but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after. after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. but it was at least. that and not. firing me. but but but yeah but so i got help but it was. but it wasn't soon enough. uh not. not as much as i should. um. i go to a couple of. meetings. i go to i go to a_a so that i can. um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. um unfortunately you know being unemployed. my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so. you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing. somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really. very. i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so. it's basically to keep my medication coming. and then there's you <laughter>. right. well like i said i mean. just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now. um just saying stuff outloud is just. like getting getting this stuff out. trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. that you can actually deal with. is a big step like. regardless of who. you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that. stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can. talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. yeah. um. you know better than i than i have been um i mean. it it sort of. it goes <g> it has its ups and downs. um you know i'm applying for jobs. five six jobs. or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview. never even getting close to. to to being self sufficient again. um. it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control. so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is. it just has its it's just its own own challenge. yeah. um. it was probably you know a couple years ago. um. i i was. i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. uh. is. everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close. we were having fun together. and we went out and got a christmas tree. and. we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just. feeling like a part of somebody's life. and feeling like a part of the bigger. the bigger life. that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. you know for that instant i felt like. a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and. you know everything was going really well and. i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person. a normal happy person. and. part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. i don't know if i'll ever feel that again. so. um. probably the. probably this. educational <educary> educational series i did uh. an educational. uh video series i did for the national science foundation. um. it was. it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and. you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um. and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to. the world. oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um. it was it was a. we were trying to come up with. with new ideas uh. for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know. to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big. you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um. and there was a lot to it and so. it was probably the biggest. project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. right that doesn't yeah. um. i guess. <grunt>. i don't know <laughter> uh. i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i. i i i don't know. thank you.",

but i'm just kind of. not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. it's not easy it's. it's kind of um. i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job. um i miss um some friends um. i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot. um i feel like i failed. and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard. depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable. um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy. so that doesn't really answer your question but. um [clears throat]. i have certain. i do i do a lot of writing. um i have certain. music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can. when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of. happening really um. it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess. um. a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel. and when i was really. when i was really getting into writing it and um. it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed. um. it was about a. guy who is searching for. something it's. it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he. that he. met and just. was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because. sort of uh it's sort of romantic. adventure comedy kind of thing. well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting. um so i wrote some screenplays and uh. you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer. just creative writing so. i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to. to really hit me. it's not easy the [exhale]. the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um. i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i. hate it because it's so difficult. um. but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good. good i don't i don't really have a temper i. it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can. lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much. try to it when i'm upset. i i get upset with myself not with other people. um. last night i guess well <weh> um. i got in an argument about whether or not. cleaning vegetables was necessary because of. i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay. so it turned into this. big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i. i ended up being wrong on that one but. it is. yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. um. uh. a lot so much um. uh. i. i. i was in uh a relationship that i really really. um. that i really wanted to work. and. uh. i ended up and it was partly due to. i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going. at like everything sort of spiraled out of. control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't. i wasn't mean but i was. but i was getting more and more messed up. and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not. and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. so. that was pretty that was pretty tough. well some of it was was that. i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's. completely kind of i mean i still get. i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not. i don't completely lose it for days at a time. um. so. i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then. i would've i would i would be. i would be. it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have. i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different. things being how they were. i mean it's. it's possible uh. i mean obviously. yeah because i mean that's what i do i i. take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until. until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff. um. and it's like any little detail that comes up. i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still. i still get. i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school. which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there. well it's it's not. easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by. by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. um well like i said i do a lot of. you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost. be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be. you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just. keep my mind occupied during all of that. um. i just need i mean. i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet. they're triggered by everything. pretty much anything that i that i see if i. if i. if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about. just. anything you know i can reach back and connect. to. to this it's really it's really. i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break. from it. yeah. um. i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i. awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally. you know don't. i don't know i never really needed much sleep so. it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly. you know i get up i toss and turn all night. you know and now. it's just. it's. yeah i don't sleep too great right now. um. pretty i mean. i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i. i usually just kind of power through it and just. i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel. bad. um. i think. about three three four years ago. um. it was when i. i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for. for. years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got. this. situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like. even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so. so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately. it happened after everything uh went bad so. i don't know. in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel. it really makes me. angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm. that i had to that i i lost everything because. because of. chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control. and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't. it was it didn't help it didn't work until. until. you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but. it was a little it's a little late now. um. there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was. it was either. i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different. but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after. after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. but it was at least. that and not. firing me. but but but yeah but so i got help but it was. but it wasn't soon enough. uh not. not as much as i should. um. i go to a couple of. meetings. i go to i go to a_a so that i can. um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. um unfortunately you know being unemployed. my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so. you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing. somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really. very. i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so. it's basically to keep my medication coming. and then there's you <laughter>. right. well like i said i mean. just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now. um just saying stuff outloud is just. like getting getting this stuff out. trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. that you can actually deal with. is a big step like. regardless of who. you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that. stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can. talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. yeah. um. you know better than i than i have been um i mean. it it sort of. it goes <g> it has its ups and downs. um you know i'm applying for jobs. five six jobs. or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview. never even getting close to. to to being self sufficient again. um. it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control. so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is. it just has its it's just its own own challenge. yeah. um. it was probably you know a couple years ago. um. i i was. i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. uh. is. everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close. we were having fun together. and we went out and got a christmas tree. and. we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just. feeling like a part of somebody's life. and feeling like a part of the bigger. the bigger life. that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. you know for that instant i felt like. a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and. you know everything was going really well and. i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person. a normal happy person. and. part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. i don't know if i'll ever feel that again. so. um. probably the. probably this. educational <educary> educational series i did uh. an educational. uh video series i did for the national science foundation. um. it was. it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and. you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um. and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to. the world. oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um. it was it was a. we were trying to come up with. with new ideas uh. for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know. to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big. you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um. and there was a lot to it and so. it was probably the biggest. project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. right that doesn't yeah. um. i guess. <grunt>. i don't know <laughter> uh. i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i. i i i don't know. thank you.",

lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um. to be with. uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of. i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of. not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. it's not easy it's. it's kind of um. i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job. um i miss um some friends um. i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot. um i feel like i failed. and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard. depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable. um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy. so that doesn't really answer your question but. um [clears throat]. i have certain. i do i do a lot of writing. um i have certain. music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can. when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of. happening really um. it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess. um. a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel. and when i was really. when i was really getting into writing it and um. it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed. um. it was about a. guy who is searching for. something it's. it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he. that he. met and just. was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because. sort of uh it's sort of romantic. adventure comedy kind of thing. well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting. um so i wrote some screenplays and uh. you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer. just creative writing so. i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to. to really hit me. it's not easy the [exhale]. the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um. i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i. hate it because it's so difficult. um. but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good. good i don't i don't really have a temper i. it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can. lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much. try to it when i'm upset. i i get upset with myself not with other people. um. last night i guess well <weh> um. i got in an argument about whether or not. cleaning vegetables was necessary because of. i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay. so it turned into this. big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i. i ended up being wrong on that one but. it is. yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. um. uh. a lot so much um. uh. i. i. i was in uh a relationship that i really really. um. that i really wanted to work. and. uh. i ended up and it was partly due to. i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going. at like everything sort of spiraled out of. control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't. i wasn't mean but i was. but i was getting more and more messed up. and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not. and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. so. that was pretty that was pretty tough. well some of it was was that. i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's. completely kind of i mean i still get. i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not. i don't completely lose it for days at a time. um. so. i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then. i would've i would i would be. i would be. it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have. i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different. things being how they were. i mean it's. it's possible uh. i mean obviously. yeah because i mean that's what i do i i. take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until. until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff. um. and it's like any little detail that comes up. i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still. i still get. i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school. which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there. well it's it's not. easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by. by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. um well like i said i do a lot of. you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost. be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be. you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just. keep my mind occupied during all of that. um. i just need i mean. i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet. they're triggered by everything. pretty much anything that i that i see if i. if i. if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about. just. anything you know i can reach back and connect. to. to this it's really it's really. i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break. from it. yeah. um. i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i. awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally. you know don't. i don't know i never really needed much sleep so. it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly. you know i get up i toss and turn all night. you know and now. it's just. it's. yeah i don't sleep too great right now. um. pretty i mean. i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i. i usually just kind of power through it and just. i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel. bad. um. i think. about three three four years ago. um. it was when i. i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for. for. years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got. this. situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like. even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so. so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately. it happened after everything uh went bad so. i don't know. in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel. it really makes me. angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm. that i had to that i i lost everything because. because of. chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control. and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't. it was it didn't help it didn't work until. until. you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but. it was a little it's a little late now. um. there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was. it was either. i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different. but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after. after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. but it was at least. that and not. firing me. but but but yeah but so i got help but it was. but it wasn't soon enough. uh not. not as much as i should. um. i go to a couple of. meetings. i go to i go to a_a so that i can. um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. um unfortunately you know being unemployed. my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so. you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing. somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really. very. i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so. it's basically to keep my medication coming. and then there's you <laughter>. right. well like i said i mean. just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now. um just saying stuff outloud is just. like getting getting this stuff out. trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. that you can actually deal with. is a big step like. regardless of who. you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that. stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can. talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. yeah. um. you know better than i than i have been um i mean. it it sort of. it goes <g> it has its ups and downs. um you know i'm applying for jobs. five six jobs. or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview. never even getting close to. to to being self sufficient again. um. it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control. so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is. it just has its it's just its own own challenge. yeah. um. it was probably you know a couple years ago. um. i i was. i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. uh. is. everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close. we were having fun together. and we went out and got a christmas tree. and. we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just. feeling like a part of somebody's life. and feeling like a part of the bigger. the bigger life. that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. you know for that instant i felt like. a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and. you know everything was going really well and. i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person. a normal happy person. and. part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. i don't know if i'll ever feel that again. so. um. probably the. probably this. educational <educary> educational series i did uh. an educational. uh video series i did for the national science foundation. um. it was. it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and. you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um. and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to. the world. oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um. it was it was a. we were trying to come up with. with new ideas uh. for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know. to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big. you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um. and there was a lot to it and so. it was probably the biggest. project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. right that doesn't yeah. um. i guess. <grunt>. i don't know <laughter> uh. i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i. i i i don't know. thank you.",

different kind of. um. attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i. but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here. uh not at all um. when i left things got things were sort of i. i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um. to be with. uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of. i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of. not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. it's not easy it's. it's kind of um. i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job. um i miss um some friends um. i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot. um i feel like i failed. and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard. depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable. um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy. so that doesn't really answer your question but. um [clears throat]. i have certain. i do i do a lot of writing. um i have certain. music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can. when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of. happening really um. it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess. um. a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel. and when i was really. when i was really getting into writing it and um. it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed. um. it was about a. guy who is searching for. something it's. it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he. that he. met and just. was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because. sort of uh it's sort of romantic. adventure comedy kind of thing. well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting. um so i wrote some screenplays and uh. you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer. just creative writing so. i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to. to really hit me. it's not easy the [exhale]. the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um. i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i. hate it because it's so difficult. um. but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good. good i don't i don't really have a temper i. it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can. lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much. try to it when i'm upset. i i get upset with myself not with other people. um. last night i guess well <weh> um. i got in an argument about whether or not. cleaning vegetables was necessary because of. i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay. so it turned into this. big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i. i ended up being wrong on that one but. it is. yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. um. uh. a lot so much um. uh. i. i. i was in uh a relationship that i really really. um. that i really wanted to work. and. uh. i ended up and it was partly due to. i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going. at like everything sort of spiraled out of. control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't. i wasn't mean but i was. but i was getting more and more messed up. and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not. and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. so. that was pretty that was pretty tough. well some of it was was that. i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's. completely kind of i mean i still get. i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not. i don't completely lose it for days at a time. um. so. i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then. i would've i would i would be. i would be. it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have. i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different. things being how they were. i mean it's. it's possible uh. i mean obviously. yeah because i mean that's what i do i i. take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until. until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff. um. and it's like any little detail that comes up. i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still. i still get. i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school. which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there. well it's it's not. easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by. by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. um well like i said i do a lot of. you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost. be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be. you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just. keep my mind occupied during all of that. um. i just need i mean. i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet. they're triggered by everything. pretty much anything that i that i see if i. if i. if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about. just. anything you know i can reach back and connect. to. to this it's really it's really. i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break. from it. yeah. um. i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i. awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally. you know don't. i don't know i never really needed much sleep so. it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly. you know i get up i toss and turn all night. you know and now. it's just. it's. yeah i don't sleep too great right now. um. pretty i mean. i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i. i usually just kind of power through it and just. i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel. bad. um. i think. about three three four years ago. um. it was when i. i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for. for. years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got. this. situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like. even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so. so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately. it happened after everything uh went bad so. i don't know. in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel. it really makes me. angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm. that i had to that i i lost everything because. because of. chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control. and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't. it was it didn't help it didn't work until. until. you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but. it was a little it's a little late now. um. there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was. it was either. i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different. but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after. after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. but it was at least. that and not. firing me. but but but yeah but so i got help but it was. but it wasn't soon enough. uh not. not as much as i should. um. i go to a couple of. meetings. i go to i go to a_a so that i can. um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. um unfortunately you know being unemployed. my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so. you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing. somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really. very. i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so. it's basically to keep my medication coming. and then there's you <laughter>. right. well like i said i mean. just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now. um just saying stuff outloud is just. like getting getting this stuff out. trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. that you can actually deal with. is a big step like. regardless of who. you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that. stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can. talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. yeah. um. you know better than i than i have been um i mean. it it sort of. it goes <g> it has its ups and downs. um you know i'm applying for jobs. five six jobs. or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview. never even getting close to. to to being self sufficient again. um. it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control. so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is. it just has its it's just its own own challenge. yeah. um. it was probably you know a couple years ago. um. i i was. i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. uh. is. everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close. we were having fun together. and we went out and got a christmas tree. and. we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just. feeling like a part of somebody's life. and feeling like a part of the bigger. the bigger life. that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. you know for that instant i felt like. a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and. you know everything was going really well and. i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person. a normal happy person. and. part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. i don't know if i'll ever feel that again. so. um. probably the. probably this. educational <educary> educational series i did uh. an educational. uh video series i did for the national science foundation. um. it was. it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and. you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um. and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to. the world. oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um. it was it was a. we were trying to come up with. with new ideas uh. for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know. to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big. you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um. and there was a lot to it and so. it was probably the biggest. project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. right that doesn't yeah. um. i guess. <grunt>. i don't know <laughter> uh. i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i. i i i don't know. thank you.",

come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again. it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um. but living. l_a is very has a very different kind of. um. attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i. but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here. uh not at all um. when i left things got things were sort of i. i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um. to be with. uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of. i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of. not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. it's not easy it's. it's kind of um. i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job. um i miss um some friends um. i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot. um i feel like i failed. and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard. depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable. um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy. so that doesn't really answer your question but. um [clears throat]. i have certain. i do i do a lot of writing. um i have certain. music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can. when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of. happening really um. it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess. um. a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel. and when i was really. when i was really getting into writing it and um. it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed. um. it was about a. guy who is searching for. something it's. it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he. that he. met and just. was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because. sort of uh it's sort of romantic. adventure comedy kind of thing. well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting. um so i wrote some screenplays and uh. you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer. just creative writing so. i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to. to really hit me. it's not easy the [exhale]. the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um. i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i. hate it because it's so difficult. um. but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good. good i don't i don't really have a temper i. it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can. lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much. try to it when i'm upset. i i get upset with myself not with other people. um. last night i guess well <weh> um. i got in an argument about whether or not. cleaning vegetables was necessary because of. i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay. so it turned into this. big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i. i ended up being wrong on that one but. it is. yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. um. uh. a lot so much um. uh. i. i. i was in uh a relationship that i really really. um. that i really wanted to work. and. uh. i ended up and it was partly due to. i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going. at like everything sort of spiraled out of. control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't. i wasn't mean but i was. but i was getting more and more messed up. and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not. and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. so. that was pretty that was pretty tough. well some of it was was that. i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's. completely kind of i mean i still get. i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not. i don't completely lose it for days at a time. um. so. i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then. i would've i would i would be. i would be. it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have. i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different. things being how they were. i mean it's. it's possible uh. i mean obviously. yeah because i mean that's what i do i i. take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until. until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff. um. and it's like any little detail that comes up. i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still. i still get. i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school. which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there. well it's it's not. easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by. by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. um well like i said i do a lot of. you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost. be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be. you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just. keep my mind occupied during all of that. um. i just need i mean. i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet. they're triggered by everything. pretty much anything that i that i see if i. if i. if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about. just. anything you know i can reach back and connect. to. to this it's really it's really. i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break. from it. yeah. um. i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i. awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally. you know don't. i don't know i never really needed much sleep so. it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly. you know i get up i toss and turn all night. you know and now. it's just. it's. yeah i don't sleep too great right now. um. pretty i mean. i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i. i usually just kind of power through it and just. i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel. bad. um. i think. about three three four years ago. um. it was when i. i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for. for. years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got. this. situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like. even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so. so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately. it happened after everything uh went bad so. i don't know. in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel. it really makes me. angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm. that i had to that i i lost everything because. because of. chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control. and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't. it was it didn't help it didn't work until. until. you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but. it was a little it's a little late now. um. there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was. it was either. i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different. but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after. after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. but it was at least. that and not. firing me. but but but yeah but so i got help but it was. but it wasn't soon enough. uh not. not as much as i should. um. i go to a couple of. meetings. i go to i go to a_a so that i can. um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. um unfortunately you know being unemployed. my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so. you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing. somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really. very. i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so. it's basically to keep my medication coming. and then there's you <laughter>. right. well like i said i mean. just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now. um just saying stuff outloud is just. like getting getting this stuff out. trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. that you can actually deal with. is a big step like. regardless of who. you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that. stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can. talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. yeah. um. you know better than i than i have been um i mean. it it sort of. it goes <g> it has its ups and downs. um you know i'm applying for jobs. five six jobs. or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview. never even getting close to. to to being self sufficient again. um. it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control. so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is. it just has its it's just its own own challenge. yeah. um. it was probably you know a couple years ago. um. i i was. i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. uh. is. everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close. we were having fun together. and we went out and got a christmas tree. and. we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just. feeling like a part of somebody's life. and feeling like a part of the bigger. the bigger life. that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. you know for that instant i felt like. a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and. you know everything was going really well and. i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person. a normal happy person. and. part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. i don't know if i'll ever feel that again. so. um. probably the. probably this. educational <educary> educational series i did uh. an educational. uh video series i did for the national science foundation. um. it was. it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and. you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um. and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to. the world. oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um. it was it was a. we were trying to come up with. with new ideas uh. for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know. to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big. you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um. and there was a lot to it and so. it was probably the biggest. project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. right that doesn't yeah. um. i guess. <grunt>. i don't know <laughter> uh. i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i. i i i don't know. thank you.",

i'm from greenwich connecticut. yes. um i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago. um i try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less. um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general. um. i think that. other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there. are just more my. type and what i'm used to and. it's less superficial. <tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california. um initially it was easy because i felt like. it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just. are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in. how different it is and. what life is out here it became more difficult than originally. uh fine arts and photography. um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and. got awards and things like that and publishments. so i decided to pursue art. um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and. scrubbed_entry. yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um. i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography. i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting. um. that's a interesting question. i guess just my childhood in general. growing up. um well my family's very close. um. my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live. within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that. yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is. more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries. um i consider myself more shy. um. i. watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted. um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and. just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to. um. i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having. if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger. um. well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like. insignificant things. but other than that. um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago. um. there's been like some tension going on. since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter. things about his girlfriend and. he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to. have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. so for like the thirtieth time he. we were on the phone and he was. <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and. he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i. i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me. um. i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish. that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue. but the thing is is that he says. certain things that are untrue. or things he knows that like will tick me off. that are really nasty and. that he shouldn't be saying to me so he. so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really. mm like not say anything. um. well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't. i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to. after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically. changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now. that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made. um. well i wish i could erase. the event or seeing. my grandmother's funeral which. obviously it wouldn't change anything. but. it wasn't. seeing her there was not something i'd wanna. like have in my memory. um she was she was a very positive influence and always. was not judgmental. um. and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people. so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people. they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you. are older. um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep. no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m. i will be up like clockwork. by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to. figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer. no i just. in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's. i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning. <tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring. but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday. um. i don't know i kind of just feel very. mm. like so so. just. no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of. one note land. i mean nothing like lately. um. like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and. just reserved and. not very outgoing. no. no i have been diagnosed with anxiety. um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital. um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but. they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety. i think in the right setting and. with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist. is helpful. and good at what they're doing then yeah. no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid. um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like. deal with whatever issues they were having with me. but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day. it wasn't. i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it. <sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday. when i'm there i can always just. we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to. worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out. just enjoy the day. in general. um. i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't. being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and. the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here. so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or. you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even. that it was more like a transfer school like you. you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went. so it kind of create created more problems for me. <sigh>. well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago. i would give myself the advice to. probably stay closer to home. and to have. really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california. um. my best friend would describe me. as a great charismatic funny outgoing. socially enjoyable person which is different than how. people who aren't my good friends would describe me. which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i. am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just. i am very shy and. don't really. speak much. um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that. yeah. um. i'm very caring. i. i'm a very good judge of character. which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself. um. i'm very affectionate <aff>. i mean. i'm not very affectionate i'm more. i mean i guess i guess so. thanks.",

easy the problem is staying alseep. no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m. i will be up like clockwork. by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to. figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer. no i just. in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's. i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning. <tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring. but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday. um. i don't know i kind of just feel very. mm. like so so. just. no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of. one note land. i mean nothing like lately. um. like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and. just reserved and. not very outgoing. no. no i have been diagnosed with anxiety. um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital. um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but. they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety. i think in the right setting and. with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist. is helpful. and good at what they're doing then yeah. no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid. um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like. deal with whatever issues they were having with me. but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day. it wasn't. i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it. <sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday. when i'm there i can always just. we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to. worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out. just enjoy the day. in general. um. i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't. being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and. the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here. so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or. you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even. that it was more like a transfer school like you. you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went. so it kind of create created more problems for me. <sigh>. well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago. i would give myself the advice to. probably stay closer to home. and to have. really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california. um. my best friend would describe me. as a great charismatic funny outgoing. socially enjoyable person which is different than how. people who aren't my good friends would describe me. which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i. am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just. i am very shy and. don't really. speak much. um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that. yeah. um. i'm very caring. i. i'm a very good judge of character. which i mean i

was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just. are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in. how different it is and. what life is out here it became more difficult than originally. uh fine arts and photography. um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and. got awards and things like that and

initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography. i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting. um. that's a interesting question. i guess just my childhood in general. growing up. um well my family's very close. um. my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live. within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that. yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is. more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries. um i consider myself more shy. um. i. watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted. um i watch like bravo t_v like the real

definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger. um. well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like. insignificant things. but other than that. um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago. um. there's been like some tension going on. since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter. things about his girlfriend and. he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to. have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. so for like the thirtieth time he. we were on the phone and he was. <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and. he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i. i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me. um. i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish. that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue. but the thing is is that he says. certain things that are untrue. or things he knows that like will tick me off. that are really nasty and. that he shouldn't be saying to me so he. so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really. mm like not say anything. um. well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't. i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to. after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically. changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now. that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made. um. well i wish i could erase. the event or seeing. my grandmother's funeral which. obviously it wouldn't change anything. but. it wasn't. seeing her there was not something i'd wanna. like have in my memory. um she was she was a very positive influence and always. was not judgmental. um. and now i mean my parents are great role models just in

like where i'm from better than l_a in general. um. i think that. other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there. are just more my. type and what i'm used to and. it's less superficial. <tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california. um initially it was easy because i felt like. it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just. are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in. how different it is and. what life is out here it became more difficult than originally. uh fine arts and photography. um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and. got awards and things like that and publishments. so i decided to pursue art. um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and. scrubbed_entry. yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um. i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography. i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting. um. that's a interesting question. i guess just my childhood in general. growing up. um well my family's very close. um. my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live. within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that. yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is. more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries. um i consider myself more shy. um. i. watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted. um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and. just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to. um. i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having. if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger. um. well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like. insignificant things. but other than that. um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago. um. there's been like some tension going on. since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter. things about his girlfriend and. he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to. have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. so for like the thirtieth time he. we were on the phone and he was. <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and. he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i. i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me. um. i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish. that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue. but the thing is is that he says. certain things that are untrue. or things he knows that like will tick me off. that are really nasty and. that he shouldn't be saying to me so he. so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really. mm like not say anything. um. well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't. i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to. after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically. changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now. that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made. um. well i wish i could erase. the event or seeing. my grandmother's funeral which. obviously it wouldn't change anything. but. it wasn't. seeing her there was not something i'd wanna. like have in my memory. um she was she was a very positive influence and always. was not judgmental. um. and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people. so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people. they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you. are older. um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep. no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m. i will be up like clockwork. by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to. figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer. no i just. in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's. i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning. <tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring. but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday. um. i don't know i kind of just feel very. mm. like so so. just. no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of. one note land. i mean nothing like lately. um. like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and. just reserved and. not very outgoing. no. no i have been diagnosed with anxiety. um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital. um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but. they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety. i think in the right setting and. with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist. is helpful. and good at what they're doing then yeah. no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid. um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like. deal with whatever issues they were having with me. but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day. it wasn't. i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it. <sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday. when i'm there i can always just. we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to. worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out. just enjoy the day. in general. um. i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't. being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and. the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here. so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or. you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even. that it was more like a transfer school like you. you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went. so it kind of create created more problems for me. <sigh>. well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago. i would give myself the advice to. probably stay closer to home. and to have. really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california. um. my best friend would describe me. as a great charismatic funny outgoing. socially enjoyable person which is different than how. people who aren't my good friends would describe me. which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i. am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just. i am very shy and. don't really. speak much. um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that. yeah. um. i'm very caring. i. i'm a very good judge of character. which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself. um. i'm very affectionate <aff>. i mean. i'm not very affectionate i'm more. i mean i guess i guess so. thanks.",

so you kind of adapt and just. are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in. how different it is and. what life is out here it became more difficult than originally. uh fine arts and photography. um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and. got awards and things like that and publishments. so i decided to

was freelance photography. i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting. um. that's a interesting question. i guess just my childhood in general. growing up. um well my family's very close. um. my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live. within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that. yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is. more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different

with my dad a few days ago. um. there's been like some tension going on. since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter. things about his girlfriend and. he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to. have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. so for like the thirtieth time he. we were on the phone and he was. <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and. he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i. i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me. um. i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish. that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue. but the thing is is that he says. certain things that are untrue. or things he knows that like will tick me off. that are really nasty and. that he shouldn't be saying to me so he. so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really. mm like not say anything. um. well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't. i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to. after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically. changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now. that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made. um. well i wish i could erase. the event or seeing. my grandmother's funeral which. obviously it wouldn't change anything. but. it wasn't. seeing her there was not something i'd

where i'm from better than l_a in general. um. i think that. other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there. are just more my. type and what i'm used to and. it's less superficial. <tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california. um initially it was easy because i felt like. it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just. are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in. how different it is and. what life is out here it became more difficult than originally. uh fine arts and photography. um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and. got awards and things like that and publishments. so i decided to pursue art. um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and. scrubbed_entry. yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um. i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography. i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting. um. that's a interesting question. i guess just my childhood in general. growing up. um well my family's very close. um. my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live. within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that. yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is. more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries. um i consider myself more shy. um. i. watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted. um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and. just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to. um. i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having. if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger. um. well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like. insignificant things. but other than that. um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago. um. there's been like some tension going on. since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter. things about his girlfriend and. he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to. have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. so for like the thirtieth time he. we were on the phone and he was. <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and. he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i. i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me. um. i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish. that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue. but the thing is is that he says. certain things that are untrue. or things he knows that like will tick me off. that are really nasty and. that he shouldn't be saying to me so he. so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really. mm like not say anything. um. well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't. i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to. after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically. changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now. that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made. um. well i wish i could erase. the event or seeing. my grandmother's funeral which. obviously it wouldn't change anything. but. it wasn't. seeing her there was not something i'd wanna. like have in my memory. um she was she was a very positive influence and always. was not judgmental. um. and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people. so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people. they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you. are older. um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep. no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m. i will be up like clockwork. by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to. figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer. no i just. in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's. i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning. <tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring. but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday. um. i don't know i kind of just feel very. mm. like so so. just. no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of. one note land. i mean nothing like lately. um. like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and. just reserved and. not very outgoing. no. no i have been diagnosed with anxiety. um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital. um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but. they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety. i think in the right setting and. with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist. is helpful. and good at what they're doing then yeah. no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid. um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like. deal with whatever issues they were having with me. but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day. it wasn't. i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it. <sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday. when i'm there i can always just. we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to. worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out. just enjoy the day. in general. um. i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't. being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and. the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here. so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or. you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even. that it was more like a transfer school like you. you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went. so it kind of create created more problems for me. <sigh>. well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago. i would give myself the advice to. probably stay closer to home. and to have. really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california. um. my best friend would describe me. as a great charismatic funny outgoing. socially enjoyable person which is different than how. people who aren't my good friends would describe me. which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i. am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just. i am very shy and. don't really. speak much. um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that. yeah. um. i'm very caring. i. i'm a very good judge of character. which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself. um. i'm very affectionate <aff>. i mean. i'm not very affectionate i'm more. i mean i guess i guess so. thanks.",

spending so. i'm good at resolving <reso> resolving like consumer conflicts and stuff on the job. i had a drunk friend that was just. falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and i kinda. started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrasing and what she was saying to people was very mean you know. and i wonder like if you're talking to people like that. they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is l_a. <laughter>. i really don't feel guilty about anything decisions i've made in my life i've. think i've made really good decisions and i always stick with my moral compass what i'm doing i grew up in church so. i haven't gone in years but i still have those values and. you know the rules the ten commandments and stuff in my head. i had a slum lord landlord and um. i wish that i called you know the proper authorities and. followed through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code. i. a few years back i was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back  to where he was from. and after a few months you know he was coming to l_a and going back home i. decided to move there and i had just started. you know this business i was doing event planning was picking up and i decided to leave there. and try to do it there and  you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but. it was tough deciding like should i leave l_a and make this. jump and trace something new and experience something new or stay in what i was doing. i was i had a degree in dental assisting i did that for like a year i didn't like it and then i was studying communications. like radio and television broadcasting and journalism. um somewhat i'm doing event work and i wrote for a magazine a couple years and i'm trying to like. get a website going and then have like where i'm controlling my own writing and what's going on instead of. you know

really living 'cause sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and seeing other places you realize that. you know life is about a lotta different things that you don't think about every day. well um. one of my trips i went uh. i went to. singapore and then to thailand. and it was when i was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to um. he had <ha> he was uh. uh. a sales engineer. or systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days. and that was really interesting um you know of course. eh. it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something. but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and. um. after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really. it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really. there's not a lotta crime but the government is very it it's a little bit imposing. but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost <almo> it was really completely different 'cause it's like jungle. we went to um. phuket it's a little island. and it was just it was very. primitive compared to. singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap. had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter>. it was interesting yeah. yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter>. mm. well i'm in school right now. and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um. i had health problems. so um here i am i'm. i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c. yeah. i'm happy. ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian. but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and. in in a veterinary capacity. yeah. i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and. how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not. yeah. <laughter>. <laughter>. uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping. um. i like. like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand. or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or. a lotta times i can just lay there and. my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing. ah really good. i don't have. i would say there's certain things that um. they can really. like make me. like when i see injustices or things like that then. i mean i can really feel it. but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or. uh even you know yell <laughter>. <sigh>. argued. um <sigh>. i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument. like if we just. well. uh i would say last summer. when. um. i think it was after a. baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to. we went to have shabu shabu after the game. and. i don't know i think. scrubbed_entry. and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like. mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her. um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any. deep problems but um. sometimes we just have. she's very touchy. and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do. so i think. she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm. you know i just kinda. that's just how she is. and then i guess i said some things that she. felt were. eh well she gets really. offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we. then one day she called me up and then we were friends again. but like she never she never confronted me. hardest decision <sigh>. uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend. uh well. it wasn't. <sigh>. it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it. for like five years. um. you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just. had a lot of um. we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements. so i had thought about it and thought about it and. we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so. i don't know uh. i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally. eh we were just always having. um. we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um. we were just having these little snippy. disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and. um i did. it was really hard it was it was the hardest. decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um. and. but i i think it was for the best. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job. for well to help my friend start a business in nevada. and when i when i. i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach. and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome. and that was really stressful for me because um. i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't. for her wanting me to come over there um. it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left. and um. when i went over there. like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah. when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and. the other principals of the company were um. you know the <th>. it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much. and also. they were a different religion. and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh. eh i was kind of an outsider there and then. also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>. so i would say that's one decision it it's. it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um. i really wish i i had just stayed. <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say. <sigh>. my memory. like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase. is that what you're saying. mm <sigh>. can't really think of anything i mean. even like that. that bad decision that i made. you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something. and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't. <sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s>. being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but. i never feel rested and that's um. it's a medical problem of mine. well i always feel. like i haven't slept for two days and. um. there are points in in the day. i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and. and rested but they're short-lived. but i sleep a lot i sleep. uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy. yeah. well thanks <laughter>. no. <sniffle>. i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um. that's. that's usually what doctors. um. like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and. figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep. but i do. <sigh> i do <sigh>. i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well. my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down. um. i would say that i do feel down sometimes. a lotta times but it's not. i would say. it's reasonable considering. the situations that i'm in. uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult. but um. i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular. oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've. find some great new dish i like i mean. what type of happiness are you looking for. um <sigh>. well. i mean right now um. my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week. um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though. we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um. you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone. um yesterday. 'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal. <laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean. you know there's little fun things like that. <sniffle>. uh <sigh>. probably um. o_c_d <laughter> and um. she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her. um. i think that she would. say that i have a good heart um we're very different. um. and probably that i'm. <sigh>. i should ask her <laughter> uh. i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun. um but. she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that. why um. <sigh>. i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now. and <sigh>. so i don't really. tell people about them. um. it it's kind of a. it's kind of a killjoy but also. people can feel i feel that people can feel. less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of. um. it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before. even before this difficult time in my life i've been. i've been a private person i don't know why. i think <thi> i think a lot. eh you know i'm a deep thinker. and. maybe it's just. you know. not like i feels like i feel abnormal but. um. maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that. don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure. <sniffle>. ten or twenty years ago <sigh>. um. well one thing that i regret right now is um. you know i haven't really found. somebody. you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder. that's it. um i would say <sigh>. that i've perservered. i'm very proud that. even though i have a lot of. difficulties in my life. the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school. and i'm doing it on my own. and um. you know it's. it's kind of a. if people if people knew all the problems that i have. they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um. i really feel that. you know i'm i'm doing this and and i'm really proud that even through everything um yeah i'm getting a's. thanks. mm k. thanks. bye.",

engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days. and that was really interesting um you know of course. eh. it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something. but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and. um. after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really. it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really. there's not a lotta crime but the government is very it it's a little bit imposing. but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost <almo> it was really completely different 'cause it's like jungle. we went to um. phuket it's a little island. and it was just it was very. primitive compared to. singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap. had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter>. it was interesting yeah. yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter>. mm. well i'm in school right now. and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um. i had health problems. so um here i am i'm. i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c. yeah. i'm happy. ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian. but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and. in in a veterinary capacity. yeah. i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and. how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not. yeah. <laughter>. <laughter>. uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping. um. i like. like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand. or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or. a lotta times i can just lay there and. my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing. ah really good. i don't have. i would say there's certain things that um. they can really. like make me. like when i see injustices or things like that then. i mean i can really feel it. but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or. uh even you know yell <laughter>. <sigh>. argued. um <sigh>. i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument. like if we just. well. uh i would say last summer. when. um. i think it was after a. baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to. we went to have shabu shabu after the game. and. i don't know i think. scrubbed_entry. and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like. mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her. um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any. deep problems but um. sometimes we just have. she's very touchy. and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do. so i think. she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm. you know i just kinda. that's just how she is. and then i guess i said some things that she. felt were. eh well she gets really. offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we. then one day she called me up and then we were friends again. but like she never she never confronted me. hardest decision <sigh>. uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend. uh well. it wasn't. <sigh>. it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it. for like five years. um. you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just. had a lot of um. we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements. so i had thought about it and thought about it and. we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so. i don't know uh. i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally. eh we were just always having. um. we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um. we were just having these little snippy. disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and. um i did. it was really hard it was it was the hardest. decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um. and. but i i think it was for the best. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job. for well to help my friend start a business in nevada. and when i when i. i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach. and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome. and that was really stressful for me because um. i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't. for her wanting me to come over there um. it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left. and um. when i went over there. like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah. when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and. the other principals of the company were um. you know the <th>. it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much. and also. they were a different religion. and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh. eh i was kind of an outsider there and then. also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>. so i would say that's one decision it it's. it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um. i really wish i i had just stayed. <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say. <sigh>. my memory. like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase. is that

bit in a little while. oh just <sigh>. it um. it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here. um it's exciting and it makes me feel like. um i'm actually <act> i'm really living 'cause sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and seeing other places you realize that. you know life is about a lotta different things that you don't think about every day. well um. one of my trips i went uh. i went to. singapore and then to thailand. and it was when i was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to um. he had <ha> he was uh. uh. a sales engineer. or systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days. and that was really interesting um you know of course. eh. it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something. but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and. um. after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really. it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really. there's not a lotta crime but the government is very it it's a little bit imposing. but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost <almo> it was really completely different 'cause it's like jungle. we went to um. phuket it's a little island. and it was just it was very. primitive compared to. singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap. had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter>. it was interesting yeah. yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter>. mm. well i'm in school right now. and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um. i had health problems. so um here i am i'm. i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c. yeah. i'm happy. ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian. but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and. in in a veterinary capacity. yeah. i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and. how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not. yeah. <laughter>. <laughter>. uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping. um. i like. like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand. or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or. a lotta times i can just lay there and. my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing. ah really good. i don't have. i would say there's certain things that um. they can really. like make me. like when i see injustices or things like that then. i mean i can really feel it. but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or. uh even you know yell <laughter>. <sigh>. argued. um <sigh>. i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument. like if we just. well. uh i would say last summer. when. um. i think it was after a. baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to. we went to have shabu shabu after the game. and. i don't know i think. scrubbed_entry. and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like. mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her. um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any. deep problems but um. sometimes we just have. she's very touchy. and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do. so i think. she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm. you know i just kinda. that's just how she is. and then i guess i said some things that she. felt were. eh well she gets really. offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we. then one day she called me up and then we were friends again. but like she never she never confronted me. hardest decision <sigh>. uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend. uh well. it wasn't. <sigh>. it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it. for like five years. um. you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just. had a lot of um. we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements. so i had thought about it and thought about it and. we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so. i don't know uh. i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally. eh we were just always having. um. we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um. we were just having these little snippy. disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and. um i did. it was really hard it was it was the hardest. decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um. and. but i i think it was for the best. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job. for well to help my friend start a business in nevada. and when i when i. i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach. and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome. and that was really stressful for me because um. i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't. for her wanting me to come over there um. it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left. and um. when i went over there. like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah. when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and. the other principals of the company were um. you know the <th>. it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much. and also. they were a different religion. and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh. eh i was kind of an outsider there and then. also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>. so i would say that's one decision it it's. it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um. i really wish i i had just stayed. <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say. <sigh>. my memory. like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase. is that what you're saying. mm <sigh>. can't really think of anything i mean. even like that. that bad decision that i made. you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something. and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't. <sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s>. being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but. i never feel rested and that's um. it's a medical problem of mine. well i always feel. like i haven't slept for two days and. um. there are points in in the day. i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and. and rested but they're short-lived. but i sleep a lot i sleep. uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy. yeah. well thanks <laughter>. no. <sniffle>. i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um. that's. that's usually what doctors. um. like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and. figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep. but i do. <sigh> i do <sigh>. i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well. my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down. um. i would say that i do feel down sometimes. a lotta times but it's not. i would say. it's reasonable considering. the situations that i'm in. uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult. but um. i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular. oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've. find some great new dish i like i mean. what type of happiness are you looking for. um <sigh>. well. i mean right now um. my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week. um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though. we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um. you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone. um yesterday. 'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal. <laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean. you know there's little fun things like that. <sniffle>. uh <sigh>. probably um. o_c_d <laughter> and um. she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her. um. i think that she would. say that i have a good heart um we're very different. um. and probably that i'm. <sigh>. i should ask her <laughter> uh. i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun. um but. she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that. why um. <sigh>. i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now. and <sigh>. so i don't really. tell people about them. um. it it's kind of a. it's kind of a killjoy but also. people can feel i feel that people can feel. less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of. um. it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before. even before this difficult time in my life i've been. i've been a private person i don't know why. i think <thi> i think a lot. eh you know i'm a deep thinker. and. maybe it's just. you know. not like i feels like i feel abnormal but. um. maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that. don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure. <sniffle>. ten or twenty years ago <sigh>. um. well one thing that i regret right now is um. you know i haven't really found. somebody. you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder. that's it. um i would say <sigh>. that i've perservered. i'm very proud that. even though i have a lot of. difficulties in my life. the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school. and i'm doing it on my own. and um. you know it's. it's kind of a. if people if people knew all the problems that i have. they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um. i really feel that. you know i'm i'm doing this and and i'm really proud that even through everything um yeah i'm getting a's. thanks. mm k. thanks. bye.",

thought about it and. we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so. i don't know uh. i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally. eh we were just always having. um. we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um. we were just having these little snippy. disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and. um i did. it was really hard it was it was the hardest. decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um. and. but i i think it was for the best. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job. for well to help my friend start a business in nevada. and when i when i. i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach. and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome. and that was really stressful for me because um. i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't. for her wanting me to come over there um. it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left. and um. when i went over there. like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah. when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and. the other principals of the company were um. you know the <th>. it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much. and also. they were a different religion. and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh. eh i was kind of an outsider there and then. also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>. so i would say that's one decision it it's. it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um. i really wish i i had just stayed. <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say. <sigh>. my memory. like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase. is that what you're saying. mm <sigh>. can't really think of anything i mean. even like that. that bad decision that i made. you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something. and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't. <sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s>. being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but. i never feel rested and that's um. it's a medical problem of mine. well i always feel. like i haven't slept for two days and. um. there are points in in the day. i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and. and rested but they're short-lived. but i sleep a lot i sleep. uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy. yeah. well thanks <laughter>. no. <sniffle>. i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um. that's. that's usually what doctors. um. like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and. figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep. but i do. <sigh> i do <sigh>. i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well. my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down. um. i would say that i do feel down sometimes. a lotta times but it's not. i would say. it's reasonable considering. the situations that i'm in. uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult. but um. i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular. oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've. find some great new dish i like i mean. what type of happiness are you looking for. um <sigh>. well. i mean right now um. my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week. um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though. we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um. you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone. um yesterday. 'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal. <laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean. you know there's little fun things like that. <sniffle>. uh <sigh>. probably um. o_c_d <laughter> and um. she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her. um. i think that she would. say that i have a good heart um we're very different. um. and probably that i'm. <sigh>. i should ask her <laughter> uh. i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun. um but. she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that. why um. <sigh>. i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now. and <sigh>. so i don't really. tell people about them. um. it it's kind of a. it's kind of a killjoy but also. people can feel i feel that people can feel. less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of. um. it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before. even before this difficult time in my life i've been. i've been a private person i don't know why. i think <thi> i think a lot. eh you know i'm a deep thinker. and. maybe it's just. you know. not like i feels like i feel abnormal but. um. maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that. don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure. <sniffle>. ten or twenty years ago <sigh>. um. well one thing that i regret right now is um. you know i haven't really found. somebody. you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder. that's it. um i would say <sigh>. that i've perservered. i'm very proud that. even though i have a lot of. difficulties in my life. the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school. and i'm doing it on my own. and um. you know it's. it's kind of a. if people if people knew all the problems that i have. they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um. i really feel that. you know i'm i'm doing this and and i'm really proud that even through everything um yeah i'm getting a's. thanks. mm k. thanks. bye.",

it's a little island. and it was just it was very. primitive compared to. singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap. had a

i would say there's certain things that um. they can really. like make me. like when i see injustices or things like that then. i mean i can really feel it. but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or. uh even you know yell <laughter>. <sigh>. argued. um <sigh>. i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument. like if we just. well. uh i would say last summer. when. um. i think it was after a. baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to. we went to have shabu shabu after the game. and. i don't know i think. scrubbed_entry.

engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days. and that was really interesting um you know of course. eh. it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something. but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and. um. after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really. it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really. there's not a lotta crime but the government

it's a little island. and it was just it was very. primitive compared to. singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap. had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter>. it was interesting yeah. yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter>. mm. well i'm in school right now. and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um. i had health problems. so um here i am i'm. i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c. yeah. i'm happy. ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian. but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and. in in a veterinary capacity. yeah. i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and. how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not. yeah. <laughter>. <laughter>. uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping. um. i like. like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand. or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or. a lotta times i can just lay there and. my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing. ah really good. i don't have. i would say there's certain things that um. they can really. like make me. like when i see injustices or things like that then. i mean i can really feel it. but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or. uh even you know yell <laughter>. <sigh>. argued. um <sigh>. i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument. like if we just. well. uh i would say last summer. when. um. i think it was after a. baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to. we went to have shabu shabu after the game. and. i don't know i think. scrubbed_entry. and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like. mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her. um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any. deep problems but um. sometimes we just have. she's very touchy. and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do. so i think. she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm. you know i just kinda. that's just how she is. and then i guess i said some things that she. felt were. eh well she gets really. offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we. then one day she called me up and then we were friends again. but like she never she never confronted me. hardest decision <sigh>. uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend. uh well. it wasn't. <sigh>. it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it. for like five years. um. you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just. had a lot of um. we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements. so i had thought about it and thought about it and. we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so. i don't know uh. i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally. eh we were just always having. um. we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um. we were just having these little snippy. disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and. um i did. it was really hard it was it was the hardest. decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um. and. but i i think it was for the best. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job. for well to help my friend start a business in nevada. and when i when i. i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach. and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome. and that was really stressful for me because um. i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't. for her wanting me to come over there um. it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left. and um. when i went over there. like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah. when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and. the other principals of the company were um. you know the <th>. it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much. and also. they were a different religion. and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh. eh i was kind of an outsider there and then. also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>. so i would say that's one decision it it's. it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um. i really wish i i had just stayed. <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say. <sigh>. my memory. like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase. is that what you're saying. mm <sigh>. can't really think of anything i mean. even like that. that bad decision that i made. you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something. and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't. <sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s>. being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but. i never feel rested and that's um. it's a medical problem of mine. well i always feel. like i haven't slept for two days and. um. there are points in in the day. i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and. and rested but they're short-lived. but i sleep a lot i sleep. uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy. yeah. well thanks <laughter>. no. <sniffle>. i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um. that's. that's usually what doctors. um. like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and. figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep. but i do. <sigh> i do <sigh>. i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well. my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down. um. i would say that i do feel down sometimes. a lotta times but it's not. i would say. it's reasonable considering. the situations that i'm in. uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult. but um. i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular. oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've. find some great new dish i like i mean. what type of happiness are you looking for. um <sigh>. well. i mean right now um. my friend just had

massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter>. it was interesting yeah. yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter>. mm. well i'm in school right now. and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um. i had health problems. so um here i am i'm. i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c. yeah. i'm happy. ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian. but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and. in in a veterinary capacity. yeah. i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and. how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not. yeah. <laughter>. <laughter>. uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping. um. i like. like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand. or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or. a lotta times i can just lay there and. my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing. ah really good. i don't have. i would say there's certain things that um. they can really. like make me. like when i see injustices or things like that then. i mean i can really feel it. but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or. uh even you know yell <laughter>. <sigh>. argued. um <sigh>. i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument. like if we just. well. uh i would say last summer. when. um. i think it was after a. baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to. we went to have shabu shabu after the game. and. i don't know i think. scrubbed_entry. and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like. mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her. um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any. deep problems but um. sometimes we just have. she's very touchy. and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do. so i think. she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm. you know i just kinda. that's just how she is. and then i guess i said some things that she. felt were. eh well she gets really. offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we. then one day she called me up and then we were friends again. but like she never she never confronted me. hardest decision <sigh>. uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend. uh well. it wasn't. <sigh>. it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it. for like five years. um. you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just. had a lot of um. we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements. so i had thought about it and thought about it and. we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so. i don't know uh. i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally. eh we were just always having. um. we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um. we were just having these little snippy. disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and. um i did. it was really hard it was it was the hardest. decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um. and. but i i think it was for the best. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job. for well to help my friend start a business in nevada. and when i when i. i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach. and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome. and that was really stressful for me because um. i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't. for her wanting me to come over there um. it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left. and um. when i went over there. like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah. when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and. the other principals of the company were um. you know the <th>. it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much. and also. they were a different religion. and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh. eh i was kind of an outsider there and then. also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>. so i would say that's one decision it it's. it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um. i really wish i i had just stayed. <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say. <sigh>. my memory. like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase. is that what you're saying. mm <sigh>. can't really think of anything i mean. even like that. that bad decision that i made. you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something. and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't. <sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s>. being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but. i never feel rested and that's um. it's a medical problem of mine. well i always feel. like i haven't slept for two days and. um. there are points in in the day. i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and. and rested but they're short-lived. but i sleep a lot i sleep. uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy. yeah. well thanks <laughter>. no. <sniffle>. i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um. that's. that's usually what doctors. um. like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and. figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep. but i do. <sigh> i do <sigh>. i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well. my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down. um. i would say that i do feel down sometimes. a lotta times but it's not. i would say. it's reasonable considering. the situations that i'm in. uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult. but um. i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular. oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've. find some great new dish i like i mean. what type of happiness are you looking for. um <sigh>. well. i mean right now um. my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week. um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though. we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um. you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone. um yesterday. 'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal. <laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean. you know there's little fun things like that. <sniffle>. uh <sigh>. probably um. o_c_d <laughter> and um. she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her. um. i think that she would. say that i have a good heart um we're very different. um. and probably that i'm. <sigh>. i should ask her <laughter> uh. i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun. um but. she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that. why um. <sigh>. i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now. and <sigh>. so i don't really. tell people about them. um. it it's kind of a. it's kind of a killjoy but also. people can feel i feel that people can feel. less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of. um. it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before. even before this difficult time in my life i've been. i've been a private person i don't know why. i think <thi> i think a lot. eh you know i'm a deep thinker. and. maybe it's just. you know. not like i feels like i feel abnormal but. um. maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that. don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure. <sniffle>. ten or twenty years ago <sigh>. um. well one thing that i regret right now is um. you know i haven't really found. somebody. you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder. that's it. um i would say <sigh>. that i've perservered. i'm very proud that. even though i have a lot of. difficulties in my life. the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school. and i'm doing it on my own. and um. you know it's. it's kind of a. if people if people knew all the problems that i have. they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um. i really feel that. you know i'm i'm doing this and and i'm really proud that even through everything um yeah i'm getting a's. thanks. mm k. thanks. bye.",

what you're saying. mm <sigh>. can't really think of anything i mean. even like that. that bad decision that i made. you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something. and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't. <sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s>. being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but. i never feel rested and that's um. it's a medical problem of mine. well i always feel. like i haven't slept for two days and. um. there are points in in the day. i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and. and rested but they're short-lived. but i sleep a lot i sleep. uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy. yeah. well thanks <laughter>. no. <sniffle>. i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um. that's. that's usually what doctors. um. like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and. figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep. but i do. <sigh> i do <sigh>. i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well. my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down. um. i would say that i do feel down sometimes. a lotta times but it's not. i would say. it's reasonable considering. the situations that i'm in. uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult. but um. i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular. oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've. find some great new dish i like i mean. what type of happiness are you looking for. um <sigh>. well. i mean right now um. my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week. um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though. we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um. you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone. um yesterday. 'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal. <laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean. you know there's little fun things like that. <sniffle>. uh <sigh>. probably um. o_c_d <laughter> and um. she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her. um. i think that she would. say that i have a good heart um we're very different. um. and probably that i'm. <sigh>. i should ask her <laughter> uh. i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun. um but. she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that. why um. <sigh>. i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now. and <sigh>. so i don't really. tell people about them. um. it it's kind of a. it's kind of a killjoy but also. people can feel i feel that people can feel. less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of. um. it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before. even before this difficult time in my life i've been. i've been a private person i don't know why. i think <thi> i think a lot. eh you know i'm a deep thinker. and. maybe it's just. you know. not like i feels like i feel abnormal but. um. maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that. don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure. <sniffle>. ten or twenty years ago <sigh>. um. well one thing that i regret right now is um. you know i haven't really found. somebody. you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder. that's it. um i would say <sigh>. that i've perservered. i'm very proud that. even though i have a lot of. difficulties in my life. the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school. and i'm doing it on my own. and um. you know it's. it's kind of a. if people if people knew all the problems that i have. they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um. i really feel that. you know i'm i'm doing this and and i'm really proud that even through everything um yeah i'm getting a's. thanks. mm k. thanks. bye.",

sure. alright. uh originally originally i'm from uh korea. mhm. uh when i was a year old. yes. uh almost never i've i've been to korea once. uh i love the weather <sigh> and being by the ocean and the culture has a lotta things to do the food there's a lot to like. um. the traffic um. it seems like. we're having a lot of uh economic difficulties and the. the parking tickets are super high i sometimes i'm really. annoyed by our government <laughter>. by your shoes. did you say by your shoes. <laughter> your shoes aren't showing um i have traveled a bit i'm i'm sort of traveled i haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while. oh just <sigh>. it um. it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here. um it's exciting and it makes me feel like. um i'm actually <act> i'm really living 'cause sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and seeing other places you realize that. you know life is about a lotta different things that you don't think about every day. well um. one of my trips i went uh. i went to. singapore and then to thailand. and it was when i was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to um. he had <ha> he was uh. uh. a sales engineer. or systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days. and that was really interesting um you know of course. eh. it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something. but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and. um. after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really. it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really. there's not a lotta crime but the government is very it it's a little bit imposing. but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost <almo> it was really completely different 'cause it's like jungle. we went to um. phuket it's a little island. and it was just it was very. primitive compared to. singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap. had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter>. it was interesting yeah. yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter>. mm. well i'm in school right now. and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um. i had health problems. so um here i am i'm. i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c. yeah. i'm happy. ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian. but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and. in in a veterinary capacity. yeah. i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and. how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not. yeah. <laughter>. <laughter>. uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping. um. i like. like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand. or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or. a lotta times i can just lay there and. my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing. ah really good. i don't have. i would say there's certain things that um. they can really. like make me. like when i see injustices or things like that then. i mean i can really feel it. but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or. uh even you know yell <laughter>. <sigh>. argued. um <sigh>. i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument. like if we just. well. uh i would say last summer. when. um. i think it was after a. baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to. we went to have shabu shabu after the game. and. i don't know i think. scrubbed_entry. and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like. mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her. um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any. deep problems but um. sometimes we just have. she's very touchy. and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do. so i think. she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm. you know i just kinda. that's just how she is. and then i guess i said some things that she. felt were. eh well she gets really. offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we. then one day she called me up and then we were friends again. but like she never she never confronted me. hardest decision <sigh>. uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend. uh well. it wasn't. <sigh>. it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it. for like five years. um. you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just. had a lot of um. we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements. so i had thought about it and thought about it and. we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so. i don't know uh. i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally. eh we were just always having. um. we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um. we were just having these little snippy. disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and. um i did. it was really hard it was it was the hardest. decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um. and. but i i think it was for the best. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job. for well to help my friend start a business in nevada. and when i when i. i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach. and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome. and that was really stressful for me because um. i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't. for her wanting me to come over there um. it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left. and um. when i went over there. like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah. when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and. the other principals of the company were um. you know the <th>. it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much. and also. they were a different religion. and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh. eh i was kind of an outsider there and then. also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter>. so i would say that's one decision it it's. it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um. i really wish i i had just stayed. <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say. <sigh>. my memory. like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase. is that

out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving. um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did   . thank you . um okay i'm panicky about the job situation . um you know 'cause my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now . so uh that's what's worrying me the most is my uh financial situation . yeah . um . yeah i mean . well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing . yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink  . um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself. now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving . uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um. they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would . make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin . just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state  . um not really . always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i. eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed. i do. at some point i've had. some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists . um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me. and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen  . and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist. um. well i'm not going to therapy now but . the therapy that i had before um . was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication. um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better . um i just. i wasn't getting the right therapists recently. so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so . mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know . um . i can't really think of anything right now . um . it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy . thank you <sniffle>. um . okay when i was a kid. um . i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it . so then a little while later my father . came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them . so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that  . oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences  . yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so . um. just the way that i've treated people before when. i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people. when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so . so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable . get in a career that is really stable . like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney. something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so. you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things . um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work . uh when i'm helping other people . uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood . okay thank you . you're welcome thank you . bye .",

okay when i was a kid. um . i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it . so then a little while later my father . came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them . so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that  . oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences  . yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so . um. just the way that i've treated people before when. i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people. when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so . so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable . get in a career that is really stable . like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney. something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so. you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things . um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work . uh when i'm helping other people . uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood . okay thank you . you're welcome thank you . bye .",

knowledge but uh katrina happened in two thousand five. not really. um. hmm where to begin. uh just l_a's different culturally. i have a different culture out here. it's just a different place. um it's it's bike friendly. louisiana isn't. new orleans for that matter really isn't. now they're trying to be but it just it isn't that successful. <sigh> the drivers they're crazy. mm not really kind of but not much anymore. don't have the money kinda broke <laughter>. just being able to go on an adventure. um. let's see i once went to comic con on a on a bicycle like on a a three wheel bike. um and that that was pretty fun. kinda scary and dangerous. nearly got killed <laughter> it was scary <laughter>. traveling or just in general. hmm. um. i gotta say. i gotta say we were. we were heading out of um. we were. heading off the p_c_h and going into um. laguna. and laguna has this really steep hill and on sundays it's full of traffic. and i i remember going down. the the hill and my brakes weren't working and i was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't click. and i was like oh god. and i'm i'm on a three wheel bike so i'm larger than most bikes and i'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic. going down a hill. unable to brake. and i'm going down. and suddenly. there's this car that veers right into mm essentially where i'm trying to go so i. turn. sharply. in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic. and then <laughter> looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any brakes. and like not managing to keep my bike from. rolling which is painful when your bike roles kinda hurts a lot. so yeah. yeah that's it. <laughter>. um. various different things uh anthropology visual effects. kinda weird but yeah. um. i just i've always had a fascination with film. and. i i think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating. just as like the the mob mentality of people. especially. ooh dream job. um. huh. i have no idea. just a job i guess. i consider myself more outgoing. um. you know i i've never been afraid of what people think of me. like people xxx i i i like people i don't know. i'm not. i'm not afraid of what they think. eh i'm more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me. i guess so being outgoing just doesn't really. affect me. eh. um. <deep breath> <mumbling> <sigh> uh i play video games listen to music. um. yeah read books i like reading books and drawing. reading books drawing playing video games. did i think of anything did i forget anything sleeping. i like sleeping it's fun. uh <mumbling> not good. <laughter> frequently <laughter>. um. <sigh>. uh. in high school i i shoved somebody's head through a locker. um. yeah. yeah that that's not good don't ever shove someone's head into a locker. that's a great way to get suspended. um. i don't know. yeah things like that just. getting into fights. <sigh>. um. like a serious argument. um <sigh>. uh. i guess like. xxx. argument over. over. um. uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control. and gun control laws. i mean. it was like. yesterday evening. eh it was. it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally. but that was like the last argument i got into. that that's kinda what you specified i think. ooh. um. uh my entire life um. <laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh>. i have. um. about. two years ago i broke up. with like as everyone calls her my evil ex. and um. yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean. uh. eh. <sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then. like just as a person as a whole. but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like. a hundreds plus miles in a singular day. and i was in a ton of pain. like. later in the evening i got home i was like oh god. like i could barely walk um. and yeah i i think running off and. like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like. eating too much and like. just. overeating 'cause i was depressed. but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm. um. i don't think i've had a singular hard decision. i've had ever had to make. because. my my biggest thing. in life. is don't you know don't regret. don't regret. the the the things you do. just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me. that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years. like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept. and to answer your question. i think thinking about it. the hardest decision i've had to make. is. i'd say. probably. probably to break up with my ex probably. um. xxx <sigh> ooh. um <sigh> where do i begin. <sigh>. um. my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word. um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with. um just to the the people around her and to me. and. i. <deep breath>. <laughter> you know. they say you're supposed to give forgive people. for making mistakes or doing things. and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for. no matter how hard you try. and i think there are some things that once done. that that can't be. undone they just they're they're the way that they are. and i think. i think after what she did. i i like i just xxx. eh. things just fell apart after that it just it it we. mm despite us trying. it just it didn't work out. i mean. i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened. oh geez. oh man. erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening. um. huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard. um. katrina. just the experience of katrina for starters. um <laughter> my <m> my ex. i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina. 'cause that was just that that was not. i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um. in two thousand five um. uh this giant storm hit. uh. new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people. leveled the town. um. and um. i i lost a lot of friends during the storm. um. i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it. but. it's still. it's it's still there. and i think. uh i i don't know i mean. you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive. in that but there's just there's nothing the only. thing you can do. is <i> is. just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again. though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know. <laughter> earthquakes. <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather. rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming. yes. <laughter> yeah. <sigh> um. mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times. that's no surprise. um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school. um which would've been. <sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago. i don't know xxx. i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's. it's when i first was told that i was depressed. um. as far as p_t_s_d goes. um post katrina. um. and then. you know. uh just. post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing. um. i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school. it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school. and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it. um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it. um. you know. just kinda happened. no not not anymore. um. eh. <sigh>. <laughter> that's a good question um <laughter>. uh geez uh you know i really don't know. i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore. uh sometimes. sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today. and stuff and. you know. it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but. ask me in two hours and who knows. you know. um. <sigh>. i guess. it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen. and to just get on and move along with your life. um. mm essentially just. mm like carry on you know. things will happen carry on. <sigh>. um. wow <laughter> um. uh i was um. i was hanging out with my girlfriend just. hanging out. um. well for starters i mean. you <y> you can't. see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently. and uh i'd i'd make my leg better. um. let's see cane's over there. that way but anyway um <sigh>. i don't know. uh make myself less fat. <laughter>. um. i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day. um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time. like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that. i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good. like you can sleep six. you know. like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with. seven. or eight. you know. like. that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours. it's just. i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too. i mean. yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much. um. <sigh>. um. utterly insane in a good way. utterly insane in a good way. um. uh i guess. like they they would also. say like you know. there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just. you know. i i just have issues like everybody else. um specifically i have. uh asperger's so that's a form of autism. um that just kinda makes life awesome. they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric. 'cause i totally am. i just. i i don't know. i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive. and you know. who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for. so i should you know. live while i'm alive and just. go out and do stuff and not. not sit and be calm. except when i'm reading. and i like reading. <sigh>. um. uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up. um. i think. i would've told myself at the time. um. 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known. my my evil ex. um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five. i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl. don't trust her she can't be trusted. um and more importantly. don't. <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that. and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally. um. yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain. it's not worth it. <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive. maybe. yeah. uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it. um. just. i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride. i don't really feel pride. i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>. i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. who knows. do i press the button now. oh bye. okay.",

<sigh>. uh. in high school i i shoved somebody's head through a locker. um. yeah. yeah that that's not good don't ever shove someone's head into a locker. that's a great way to get suspended. um. i don't know. yeah things like that just. getting into fights. <sigh>. um. like a serious argument. um <sigh>. uh. i guess like. xxx. argument over. over. um. uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control. and gun control laws. i mean. it was like. yesterday evening. eh it was. it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally. but that was like the last argument i got into. that that's kinda what you specified i think. ooh. um. uh my entire life um. <laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh>. i have. um. about. two years ago i broke up. with like as everyone calls her my evil ex. and um. yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean. uh. eh. <sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then. like just as a person as a whole. but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like. a hundreds plus miles in a singular day. and i was in a ton of pain. like. later in the evening i got home i was like oh god. like i could barely walk um. and yeah i i think running off and. like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like. eating too much and like. just. overeating 'cause i was depressed. but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm. um. i don't think i've had a singular hard decision. i've had ever had to make. because. my my biggest thing. in life. is don't you know don't regret. don't regret. the the the things you do. just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me. that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years. like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept. and to answer your question. i think thinking about it. the hardest decision i've had to make. is. i'd say. probably. probably to break up with my ex probably. um. xxx <sigh> ooh. um <sigh> where do i begin. <sigh>. um. my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word. um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with. um just to the the people around her and to me. and. i. <deep breath>. <laughter> you know. they say you're supposed to give forgive people. for making mistakes or doing things. and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for. no matter how hard you try. and i think there are some things that once done. that that can't be. undone they just they're they're the way that they are. and i think. i think after what she did. i i like i just xxx. eh. things just fell apart after that it just it it we. mm despite us trying. it just it didn't work out. i mean. i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened. oh geez. oh man. erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening. um. huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard. um. katrina. just the experience of katrina for starters. um <laughter> my <m> my ex. i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina. 'cause that was just that that was not. i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um. in two thousand five um. uh this giant storm hit. uh. new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people. leveled the town. um. and um. i i lost a lot of friends during the storm. um. i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it. but. it's still. it's it's still there. and i think. uh i i don't know i mean. you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive. in that but there's just there's nothing the only. thing you can do. is <i> is. just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again. though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know. <laughter> earthquakes. <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather. rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming. yes. <laughter> yeah. <sigh> um. mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times. that's no surprise. um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school. um which would've been. <sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago. i don't know xxx. i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's. it's when i first was told that i was depressed. um. as far as p_t_s_d goes. um post katrina. um. and then. you know. uh just. post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing. um. i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school. it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school. and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it. um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it. um. you know. just kinda happened. no not not anymore. um. eh. <sigh>. <laughter> that's a good question um <laughter>. uh geez uh you know i really don't know. i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore. uh sometimes. sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today. and stuff and. you know. it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but. ask me in two hours and who knows. you know. um. <sigh>. i guess. it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen. and to just get on and move along with your life. um. mm essentially just. mm like carry on you know. things will happen carry on. <sigh>. um. wow <laughter> um. uh i was um. i was hanging out with my girlfriend just. hanging out. um. well for starters i mean. you <y> you can't. see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently. and uh i'd i'd make my leg better. um. let's see cane's over there. that way but anyway um <sigh>. i don't know. uh make myself less fat. <laughter>. um. i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day. um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time. like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that. i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good. like you can sleep six. you know. like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with. seven. or eight. you know. like. that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours. it's just. i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too. i mean. yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much. um. <sigh>. um. utterly insane in a good way. utterly insane in a good way. um. uh i guess. like they they would also. say like you know. there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just. you know. i i just have issues like everybody else. um specifically i have. uh asperger's so that's a form of autism. um that just kinda makes life awesome. they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric. 'cause i totally am. i just. i i don't know. i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive. and you know. who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for. so i should you know. live while i'm alive and just. go out and do stuff and not. not sit and be calm. except when i'm reading. and i like reading. <sigh>. um. uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up. um. i think. i would've told myself at the time. um. 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known. my my evil ex. um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five. i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl. don't trust her she can't be trusted. um and more importantly. don't. <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that. and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally. um. yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain. it's not worth it. <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive. maybe. yeah. uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it. um. just. i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride. i don't really feel pride. i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>. i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. who knows. do i press the button now. oh bye. okay.",

think there are some things you can't forgive people for. no matter how hard you try. and i think there are some things that once done. that that can't be. undone they just they're they're the way that they are. and i think. i think after what she did. i i like i just xxx. eh. things just fell apart after that it just it it we. mm despite us trying. it just it didn't work out. i mean. i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened. oh geez. oh man. erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening. um. huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard. um. katrina. just the experience of katrina for starters. um <laughter> my <m> my ex. i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina. 'cause that was just that that was not. i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um. in two thousand five um. uh this giant storm hit. uh. new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people. leveled the town. um. and um. i i lost a lot of friends during the storm. um. i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it. but. it's still. it's it's still there. and i think. uh i i don't know i mean. you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive. in that but there's just there's nothing the only. thing you can do. is <i> is. just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again. though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know. <laughter> earthquakes. <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather. rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming. yes. <laughter> yeah. <sigh> um. mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times. that's no surprise. um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school. um which would've been. <sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago. i don't know xxx. i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's. it's when i first was told that i was depressed. um. as far as p_t_s_d goes. um post katrina. um. and then. you know. uh just. post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing. um. i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school. it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school. and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it. um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it. um. you know. just kinda happened. no not not anymore. um. eh. <sigh>. <laughter> that's a good question um <laughter>. uh geez uh you know i really don't know. i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore. uh sometimes. sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today. and stuff and. you know. it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but. ask me in two hours and who knows. you know. um. <sigh>. i guess. it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen. and to just get on and move along with your life. um. mm essentially just. mm like carry on you know. things will happen carry on. <sigh>. um. wow <laughter> um. uh i was um. i was hanging out with my girlfriend just. hanging out. um. well for starters i mean. you <y> you can't. see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently. and uh i'd i'd make my leg better. um. let's see cane's over there. that way but anyway um <sigh>. i don't know. uh make myself less fat. <laughter>. um. i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day. um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time. like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that. i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good. like you can sleep six. you know. like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with. seven. or eight. you know. like. that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours. it's just. i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too. i mean. yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much. um. <sigh>. um. utterly insane in a good way. utterly insane in a good way. um. uh i guess. like they they would also. say like you know. there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just. you know. i i just have issues like everybody else. um specifically i have. uh asperger's so that's a form of autism. um that just kinda makes life awesome. they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric. 'cause i totally am. i just. i i don't know. i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive. and you know. who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for. so i should you know. live while i'm alive and just. go out and do stuff and not. not sit and be calm. except when i'm reading. and i like reading. <sigh>. um. uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up. um. i think. i would've told myself at the time. um. 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known. my my evil ex. um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five. i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl. don't trust her she can't be trusted. um and more importantly. don't. <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that. and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally. um. yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain. it's not worth it. <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive. maybe. yeah. uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it. um. just. i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride. i don't really feel pride. i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>. i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. who knows. do i press the button now. oh bye. okay.",

home i was like oh god. like i could barely walk um. and yeah i i think running off and. like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like. eating too much and like.

'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known. my my evil ex. um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five. i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl. don't trust her she can't be trusted. um and more importantly. don't. <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that. and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally. um. yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain. it's not worth it. <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive. maybe. yeah. uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it. um. just. i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride. i don't really feel pride. i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>. i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. who knows. do i press the button now. oh bye. okay.",

of but not much anymore. don't have the money kinda broke <laughter>. just being able to go on an adventure. um. let's see i once went to comic con on a on a bicycle like on a a three wheel bike. um and that that was pretty fun. kinda scary and dangerous. nearly got killed <laughter> it was scary <laughter>. traveling or just in general. hmm. um. i gotta say. i gotta say we were. we were heading out of um. we were. heading off the p_c_h and going into um. laguna. and laguna has this really steep hill and on sundays it's full of traffic. and i i remember going down. the the hill and my brakes weren't working and i was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't click. and i was like oh god. and i'm i'm on a three wheel bike so i'm larger than most bikes and i'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic. going down a hill. unable to brake. and i'm going down. and suddenly. there's this car that veers right into mm essentially where i'm trying to go so i. turn. sharply. in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic. and then <laughter> looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any brakes. and like not managing to keep my bike from. rolling which is painful when your bike roles kinda hurts a lot. so yeah. yeah that's it. <laughter>. um. various different things uh anthropology visual effects. kinda weird but yeah. um. i just i've always had a fascination with film. and. i i think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating. just as like the the mob mentality of people. especially. ooh dream job. um. huh. i have no idea. just a job i guess. i consider myself more outgoing. um. you know i i've never been afraid of what people think of me. like people xxx i i i like people i don't know. i'm not. i'm not afraid of what they think. eh i'm more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me. i guess so being outgoing just doesn't really. affect me. eh. um. <deep breath> <mumbling> <sigh> uh i play video games listen to music. um. yeah read books i like reading books and drawing. reading books drawing playing video games. did i think of anything did i forget anything sleeping. i like sleeping it's fun. uh <mumbling> not good. <laughter> frequently <laughter>. um. <sigh>. uh. in high school i i shoved somebody's head through a locker. um. yeah. yeah that that's not good don't ever shove someone's head into a locker. that's a great way to get suspended. um. i don't know. yeah things like that just. getting into fights. <sigh>. um. like a serious argument. um <sigh>. uh. i guess like. xxx. argument over. over. um. uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control. and gun control laws. i mean. it was like. yesterday evening. eh it was. it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally. but that was like the last argument i got into. that that's kinda what you specified i think. ooh. um. uh my entire life um. <laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh>. i have. um. about. two years ago i broke up. with like as everyone calls her my evil ex. and um. yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean. uh. eh. <sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then. like just as a person as a whole. but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like. a hundreds plus miles in a singular day. and i was in a ton of pain. like. later in the evening i got home i was like oh god. like i could barely walk um. and yeah i i think running off and. like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like. eating too much and like. just. overeating 'cause i was depressed. but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm. um. i don't think i've had a singular hard decision. i've had ever had to make. because. my my biggest thing. in life. is don't you know don't regret. don't regret. the the the things you do. just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me. that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years. like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept. and to answer your question. i think thinking about it. the hardest decision i've had to make. is. i'd say. probably. probably to break up with my ex probably. um. xxx <sigh> ooh. um <sigh> where do i begin. <sigh>. um. my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word. um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable

think there are some things you can't forgive people for. no matter how hard you try. and i think there are some things that once done. that that can't be. undone they just they're they're the way that they are. and i think. i think after what she did. i i like i just xxx. eh. things just fell apart after that it just it it we. mm despite us trying. it just it didn't work out. i mean. i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened. oh geez. oh man. erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening. um. huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard. um. katrina.

<sigh>. uh. in high school i i shoved somebody's head through a locker. um. yeah. yeah that that's not good don't ever shove someone's head into a locker. that's a great way to get suspended. um. i don't know. yeah things like that just. getting into fights. <sigh>. um. like a serious argument. um <sigh>. uh. i guess like. xxx. argument over. over. um. uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control. and gun control laws. i mean. it was like. yesterday evening. eh it was. it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally. but that was like the last argument i got into. that that's kinda what you specified i think. ooh. um. uh my entire life um. <laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh>. i have. um. about. two years ago i broke up. with like as everyone calls her my evil ex. and um. yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean. uh. eh. <sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then. like just as a person as a whole. but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like. a hundreds plus miles in a singular day. and i was in a ton of pain. like. later in the evening i got home i was like oh god. like i could barely walk um. and yeah i i think running off and. like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like. eating too much and like. just. overeating 'cause i was depressed. but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm. um. i don't think i've had a singular hard decision. i've had ever had to make. because. my my biggest thing. in life. is don't you know don't regret. don't regret. the the the things you do. just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me. that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years. like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept. and to answer your question. i think thinking about it. the hardest decision i've had to make. is. i'd say. probably. probably to break up with my ex probably. um. xxx <sigh> ooh. um <sigh> where do i begin. <sigh>. um. my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word. um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with. um just to the the people around her and to me. and. i. <deep breath>. <laughter> you know. they say you're supposed to give forgive people. for making mistakes or doing things. and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for. no matter how hard you try. and i think there are some things that once done. that that can't be. undone they just they're they're the way that they are. and i think. i think after what she did. i i like i just xxx. eh. things just fell apart after that it just it it we. mm despite us trying. it just it didn't work out. i mean. i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened. oh geez. oh man. erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening. um. huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard. um. katrina. just the experience of katrina for starters. um <laughter> my <m> my ex. i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina. 'cause that was just that that was not. i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um. in two thousand five um. uh this giant storm hit. uh. new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people. leveled the town. um. and um. i i lost a lot of friends during the storm. um. i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it. but. it's still. it's it's still there. and i think. uh i i don't know i mean. you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive. in that but there's just there's nothing the only. thing you can do. is <i> is. just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again. though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know. <laughter> earthquakes. <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather. rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming. yes. <laughter> yeah. <sigh> um. mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times. that's no surprise. um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school. um which would've been. <sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago. i don't know xxx. i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's. it's when i first was told that i was depressed. um. as far as p_t_s_d goes. um post katrina. um. and then. you know. uh just. post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing. um. i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school. it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school. and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it. um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it. um. you know. just kinda happened. no not not anymore. um. eh. <sigh>. <laughter> that's a good question um <laughter>. uh geez uh you know i really don't know. i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore. uh sometimes. sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today. and stuff and. you know. it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but. ask me in two hours and who knows. you know. um. <sigh>. i guess. it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen. and to just get on and move along with your life. um. mm essentially just. mm like carry on you know. things will happen carry on. <sigh>. um. wow <laughter> um. uh i was um. i was hanging out with my girlfriend just. hanging out. um. well for starters i mean. you <y> you can't. see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently. and uh i'd i'd make my leg better. um. let's see cane's over there. that way but anyway um <sigh>. i don't know. uh make myself less fat. <laughter>. um. i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day. um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time. like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that. i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good. like you can sleep six. you know. like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with. seven. or eight. you know. like. that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours. it's just. i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too. i mean. yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much. um. <sigh>. um. utterly insane in a good way. utterly insane in a good way. um. uh i guess. like they they would also. say like you know. there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just. you know. i i just have issues like everybody else. um specifically i have. uh asperger's so that's a form of autism. um that just kinda makes life awesome. they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric. 'cause i totally am. i just. i i don't know. i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive. and you know. who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for. so i should you know. live while i'm alive and just. go out and do stuff and not. not sit and be calm. except when i'm reading. and i like reading. <sigh>. um. uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up. um. i think. i would've told myself at the time. um. 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known. my my evil ex. um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five. i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl. don't trust her she can't be trusted. um and more importantly. don't. <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that. and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally. um. yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain. it's not worth it. <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive. maybe. yeah. uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it. um. just. i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride. i don't really feel pride. i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>. i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. who knows. do i press the button now. oh bye. okay.",

don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened. oh geez. oh man. erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening. um. huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard. um. katrina. just the experience of katrina for starters. um <laughter> my <m> my ex. i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina. 'cause that was just that that was not. i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um. in two thousand five um. uh this giant storm hit. uh. new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people. leveled the town. um. and um. i i lost a lot of friends during the storm. um. i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it. but. it's still. it's it's still there. and i think. uh i i don't know i mean. you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive. in that but there's just there's nothing the only. thing you can do. is <i> is. just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again. though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know. <laughter> earthquakes. <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather. rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming. yes. <laughter> yeah. <sigh> um. mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times. that's no surprise. um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school. um which would've been. <sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago. i don't know xxx. i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's. it's when i first was told that i was depressed. um. as far as p_t_s_d goes. um post katrina. um. and then. you know. uh just. post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing. um. i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school. it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school. and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it. um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it. um. you know. just kinda happened. no not not anymore. um. eh. <sigh>. <laughter> that's a good question um <laughter>. uh geez uh you know i really don't know. i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore. uh sometimes. sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today. and stuff and. you know. it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but. ask me in two hours and who knows. you know. um. <sigh>. i guess. it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen. and to just get on and move along with your life. um. mm essentially just. mm like carry on you know. things will happen carry on. <sigh>. um. wow <laughter> um. uh i was um. i was hanging out with my girlfriend just. hanging out. um. well for starters i mean. you <y> you can't. see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently. and uh i'd i'd make my leg better. um. let's see cane's over there. that way but anyway um <sigh>. i don't know. uh make myself less fat. <laughter>. um. i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day. um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time. like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that. i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good. like you can sleep six. you know. like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with. seven. or eight. you know. like. that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours. it's just. i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too. i mean. yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much. um. <sigh>. um. utterly insane in a good way. utterly insane in a good way. um. uh i guess. like they they would also. say like you know. there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just. you know. i i just have issues like everybody else. um specifically i have. uh asperger's so that's a form of autism. um that just kinda makes life awesome. they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric. 'cause i totally am. i just. i i don't know. i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive. and you know. who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for. so i should you know. live while i'm alive and just. go out and do stuff and not. not sit and be calm. except when i'm reading. and i like reading. <sigh>. um. uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up. um. i think. i would've told myself at the time. um. 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known. my my evil ex. um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five. i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl. don't trust her she can't be trusted. um and more importantly. don't. <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that. and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally. um. yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain. it's not worth it. <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive. maybe. yeah. uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it. um. just. i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride. i don't really feel pride. i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>. i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. who knows. do i press the button now. oh bye. okay.",

'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known. my my evil ex. um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five. i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl. don't trust her she can't be trusted. um and more importantly. don't. <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that. and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally. um. yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain. it's not worth it. <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive. maybe. yeah. uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it. um. just. i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride. i don't really feel pride. i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>. i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. who knows. do i press the button now. oh bye. okay.",

yeah things like that just. getting into fights. <sigh>. um. like a serious argument. um <sigh>. uh. i guess like. xxx. argument over. over. um. uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control. and gun control laws. i mean. it was like. yesterday evening. eh it was. it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally. but that was like the last argument i got into. that that's kinda what you specified i think. ooh. um. uh my entire life um. <laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh>. i have. um. about. two years ago i broke up. with like as everyone calls her my evil ex. and um. yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean. uh. eh. <sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then. like just as a person as a whole. but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like. a hundreds plus miles in a singular day. and i was in a ton of pain. like. later in the evening i got home i was like oh god. like i could barely walk um. and yeah i i think running off and. like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like. eating too much and like. just. overeating 'cause i was depressed. but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death. <deep breath> <sigh> hmm. um. i don't think i've had a singular hard decision. i've had ever had to make. because. my my biggest thing. in life. is don't you know don't regret. don't regret. the the the things you

you can't forgive people for. no matter how hard you try. and i think there are some things that once done. that that can't be. undone they just they're they're the way that they are. and i think. i think after what she did. i i like i just xxx. eh. things just fell apart after that it just it it we. mm despite us trying. it just it didn't work out. i mean. i i i don't know i don't really wanna

uh mexico. uh when i was young seven years old. i've been there like uh three or four times for vacation. well it's uh less stressful i don't know if it's because i'm on vacation but. i feel more at peace over there than here. well my uh family moved down here for a better life uh that was my parents. mm just the weather and the different things that you could do you could be at the beach or you could go to the mountains different variety of things to do. the traffic and sometimes <somet> yeah basically the traffic and yeah that's one of the main things. not that much i been to new york and uh mexico only. uh just uh seeing new places and finding new locations you know something new. like for a trip or. well i've been to uh in mexico i've been to the pyramids of uh. i forgot what's it called in mexico city. and i like you know about uh finding about my ancient culture since i'm uh uh mexican from mayan aztec so i like to see different things like that. well uh at school. well i did uh drop out but i came back and i'm trying to get back into it right now trying to learn uh graphic designs. well i started liking you know to take pictures doing different things and i like you know. uh going into business i like what the it entitles about. i wanna have my own business either making web pages just be able to be free. and don't being relying on someone else just be able to have freedom for myself. outgoing. well i just like to you know. be around people like to get to know people and depending on the person how i feel around 'em. i like to hear music or you know. do do different things like play sports or do different things just to unwind. well i'm getting better at it. you know. i xxx. well it was like uh. two days ago it was something about uh i needed to pay a bill or something <some> something that uh i you know i had taken care of. but the person he's like more picky about it you know he's more. you know how how girls are you know they they want everything right there and then. i have it handled you know i have it everything there and they just bugging sometimes they don't give you the space. that you need to resolve something. well i felt like i was overwhelmed i already had it resolved i just was waiting for. a check you know that's not on my control but i already had made the paper proper arrangements and she's bugging me about it and it's like. you're making you know an argument you know a storm in a glass of water. it's like mhm. well. uh differently there's couple of them but not so recently because i've been more. trying to get my life together but the decisions i made before in the past. like dropping out of school and doing other different things. mm. guilty not that much because. not really. not that i could think right off the top of my head. the hardest decision. oh it's just not on top of my head right now. an event. mm well the only things that i remember is when i black out or different things like that that i don't remember. but. not nothing like a particular only when my uh brothers died and different things like that. mhm. well my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more into trouble. and it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much get into it. no i'm hispanic i you know i like to be with my family. and you know i i like to go over there to mexico too i have a half-sister and my grandpa died he was over there in mexico. so i do uh like to have a good relationship with my family. well. my mom and dad they always work hard they always done what they had to do to pay the bills that's why sometimes i be like you know running around trying to get everythings done but done correctly not trying to take the easy way out. it's a little hard because there eh especially here in los angeles there's a lotta. different things that you could get into that's not that positive. and it's hard to stay focused on you know the correct stuff. well normally i just knock out it's not that hard it's like it takes me like half an hour or fifteen minutes but. uh sometimes i can't even wake up even with the alarm. uh they have to wake me up you know my girl has to wake me up even with the alarm going on it's like so. hard so you know i just knock out. i do get a little either i'm angry or i don't feel good and i'm not filled with energy. but i still have to know i know i have to do something so i still go through with it. i been well i been uh feeling good you know. been a little restless but not that much i had to do stuff so. i just you know put myself to do it no matter how i feel. no. nothing out of the ordinary. no. no. the last time i felt happy that was probably on the weekend that i was you know going out with a. going out have some fun and

the traffic. which is probably <probab> probably most people say. um. it's expensive to live here. those are probably the top two. uh recently i've traveled. um. well you get to see new places and and new people. you get to learn more about other cultures. and uh different ways people think. oh uh at the end of march i went to ecuador for a week. uh. um i spent most of most of one day with. with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got. um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid. trying to. you know say you know what's this what's this. uh it was very humbling. um. you know just just seeing that. you know when you don't when you're not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult. i'm probably more of a shy person. genetics i don't know why. um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction. i've also studied uh computer networking. um. it was. i guess. just uh kinda circumstances. i needed. the. the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family. and. i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain. mm. uh it's given me a lot of opportunity. but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life. well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary. uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall. uh for four years. and last year we we trained in north carolina. for one year. um and that was like theology and bible training. um. basically god put. a um. a desire in my heart to get beyond. get beyond myself and and do something for other people. to to go and. and learn about another people their culture. and to share the gospel with them. well in my immediate family. um. i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters. and then um. but i i have one older brother. uh no sisters. um. so what what do you wanna know about my family. um. i'm really close with my wife and my daughters. uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped. um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old. even though he's he's five years older than me. so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him. but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents. um. i'd say my. my youth pastor in high school. he was a real real positive influence in me. um. just he has a. he has a drive and a zeal for. for pursuing the truth. um. and just uh. studying the bible and. and because of his influence that kinda. put me on a path to wanting to study the bible. um i think i've gotten better at it. there have been. times when. you know i'll i'll get angry. and uh. you know it can just. kinda really rule over me just the frustration. and i'm the type of person that it takes me. um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to. to calm down again. but i've. i've learned um. over time that really getting angry. um and keeping that anger in doesn't. it doesn't. attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me. and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to. to keep so. when <whe> when things anger me i try to. uh. like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it. and and resolve it and come to a resolution. um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem. um <sigh>. well a. a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago. um. my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents. and her parents had already left. um eh we were just driving down to. orange country area for this trip. and. my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed. and. but hadn't really. in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had. and so. when i was trying to meet those expectations. she. um. you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted. um and kinda getting attacked for it. so. so then i i i started yelling at her. and. and we you know we had that conflict but then. you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through. and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was. um. are you asking the moment of during the conflict. uh. very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it. in your body. um. part partly i. the i guess the. anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger. so. i would think um. yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger. mm hmm hmm hmm. i guess it was um. deciding to go. um to go to our training last year. um i i felt that god had put on my heart that. that this was something i was supposed to pursue. um my wife didn't feel that way. and. i. i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue. and. but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart. so. i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it. um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um. you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going. uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh. you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do. um. but then after i kinda gave that up. then. um. then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so. um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me. tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory. um. oh let me see. i'm not sure um. i don't know i i can't really. think of anything very traumatic. um that i would wanna erase but i i think. you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda. shape who we are. and. so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase. um usually. usually it's not too bad. um. are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping. um. the the job i work the. the um. kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i. so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts. or graveyard shifts. so. um. coming home in the morning. you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep. but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work. uh it pretty easy. um. when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky. uh. i i've been feeling good lately. no not really. no. no. um. hmm. i don't know um. can't think of anything that was. kinda out of the ordinary. but. um. yesterday. we my wife and i took. took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one. um stayed with her grandma. but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played. and. yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park. um. i i think he'd say i'm a. a family man. that um. i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me. um usually my my friend i end up doing. um. different work around the house for him. 'cause i'm kind of a handyman so. so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice. um. i guess i would um. i guess i would like to be able to. um. start conversations with people. easier. uh sometimes. i have i have trouble. just talking to people. especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them. but kinda talking to people in a group. uh i wish i was a little better at that. now if it's. okay. what what i was gonna say right before that was that um. uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult. uh. advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago. um. probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life. um. that's about it. think that would made that would've made the biggest difference. in my life i think. um. well i have i have four kids and. i hope i'm raising 'em right i hope that. that um. you know the mistakes that i've made i can kinda guide them. through their their journey in life and i hope that they. end up a little. better for it than. than me. um. yeah i just hope. hope kinda through them. that i can. you know. leave <lea> leave something worthwhile. you're welcome. goodbye.",

i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall. uh for four years. and last year we we trained in north carolina. for one year. um and that was like theology and bible training. um. basically god put. a um. a desire in my heart to get beyond. get beyond myself and and do something for other people. to to go and. and learn about another people their culture. and to share the gospel with them. well in my immediate family. um. i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters. and then um. but i i have one older brother. uh no sisters. um. so what what do you wanna know about my family. um. i'm really close with my wife and my daughters. uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped. um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old. even though he's he's five years older than me. so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him. but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents. um. i'd say my. my youth pastor in high school. he was a real real positive influence in me. um. just he has a. he has a drive and a zeal for. for pursuing the truth. um. and just uh. studying the bible and. and because of his influence that kinda. put me on a path to wanting to study the bible. um i think i've gotten better at it. there have been. times when. you know i'll i'll get angry. and uh. you know it can just. kinda really rule over me just the frustration. and i'm the type of person that it takes me. um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to. to calm down again. but i've. i've learned um. over time that really getting angry. um and keeping that anger in doesn't. it doesn't. attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me. and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to. to keep so. when <whe> when things anger me i try to. uh. like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it. and and resolve it and come to a resolution. um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem. um <sigh>. well a. a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago. um. my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents. and her parents had already left. um eh we were just driving down to. orange country area for this trip. and. my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed. and. but hadn't really. in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had. and so. when i was trying to meet those expectations. she. um. you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted. um and kinda getting attacked for it. so. so then i i i started yelling at her. and. and we you know we had that conflict but then. you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through. and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was. um. are you asking the moment of during the conflict. uh. very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it. in your body. um. part partly i. the i guess the. anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger. so. i would think um. yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger. mm hmm hmm hmm. i guess it was um. deciding to go. um to go to our training last year. um i i felt that god had put on my heart that. that this was something i was supposed to pursue. um my wife didn't feel that way. and. i. i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue. and. but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart. so. i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it. um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um. you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going. uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh. you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do. um. but then after i kinda gave that up. then. um. then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so. um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me. tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory. um. oh let me see. i'm not sure um. i don't know i i can't really. think of anything very traumatic. um that i would wanna erase but i i think. you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda. shape who we are. and. so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase. um usually. usually it's not too bad. um. are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping. um. the the job i work the. the um. kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i. so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts. or graveyard shifts. so. um. coming home in the morning. you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep. but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work. uh it pretty easy. um. when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky. uh. i i've been feeling good lately. no not really. no. no. um. hmm. i don't know um. can't think of anything that was. kinda out of the ordinary. but. um. yesterday. we my wife and i took. took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one. um stayed with her grandma. but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played. and. yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park. um. i i think he'd say i'm a. a family man. that um. i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me. um usually my my friend i end up doing. um. different work around the house for him. 'cause i'm kind of a handyman so. so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice. um. i guess i would um. i guess i would like to be able to. um. start conversations with people. easier. uh sometimes. i have i have trouble. just talking to people. especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them. but kinda talking to people in a group. uh i wish i was a little better at that. now if it's. okay. what what i was gonna say right before that was that um. uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult. uh. advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago. um. probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life. um. that's about it. think that would made that would've made the biggest difference. in my life i think. um. well i have i have four kids and. i hope i'm raising 'em right i hope that. that um. you know the mistakes that i've made i can kinda guide them. through their their journey in life and i hope that they. end up a little. better for it than. than me. um. yeah i just hope. hope kinda through them. that i can. you know. leave <lea> leave something worthwhile. you're welcome. goodbye.",

parents my brother lives with my parents. um. i'd say my. my youth pastor in high school. he was a real real positive influence in me. um. just he has a. he has a drive and a zeal for. for pursuing the truth. um. and just uh. studying the bible and. and because of his influence that kinda. put me on a path to wanting to study the bible. um i think i've gotten better at it. there have been. times when. you know i'll i'll get angry. and uh. you know it can just. kinda really rule over me just the frustration. and i'm the type of person that it takes me. um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to. to calm down again. but i've. i've learned um. over time that really getting angry. um and keeping that anger in doesn't. it doesn't. attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me. and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to. to keep so. when <whe> when things anger me i try to. uh. like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it. and and resolve it and come to a resolution. um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem. um <sigh>. well a. a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago. um. my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents. and her parents had already left. um eh we were just driving down to. orange country area for this trip. and. my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed. and. but hadn't really. in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had. and so. when i was trying to meet those expectations. she. um. you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted. um and kinda getting attacked for it. so. so then i i i started yelling at her. and. and we you know we had that conflict but then. you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through. and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was. um. are you asking the moment of during the conflict. uh. very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it. in your body. um. part partly i. the i guess the. anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger. so. i would think um. yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger. mm hmm hmm hmm. i guess it was um. deciding to go. um to go to our training last year. um i i felt that god had put on my heart that. that this was something i was supposed to pursue. um my wife didn't feel that way. and. i. i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue. and. but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart. so. i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it. um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um. you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going. uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh. you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do. um. but then after i kinda gave that up. then. um. then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so. um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me. tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory. um. oh let me see. i'm not sure um. i don't know i i can't really. think of anything very traumatic. um that i would wanna erase but i i think. you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda. shape who we are. and. so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase. um usually. usually it's not too bad. um. are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping. um. the the job i work the. the um. kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i. so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts. or graveyard shifts. so. um. coming home in the morning. you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep. but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work. uh it pretty easy. um. when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky. uh. i i've been feeling good lately. no not really. no. no. um. hmm. i don't know um. can't think of anything that was. kinda out of the ordinary. but. um. yesterday. we my wife and i took. took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one. um stayed with her grandma. but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played. and. yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park. um. i i think he'd say i'm a. a family man. that um. i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me. um usually my my friend i end up doing. um. different work around the house for him. 'cause i'm kind of a handyman so. so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice. um. i guess i would um. i guess i would like to be able to. um. start conversations with people. easier. uh sometimes. i have i have trouble. just talking to people. especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them. but kinda talking to people in a group. uh i wish i was a little better at that. now if it's. okay. what what i was gonna say right before that was that um. uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult. uh. advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago. um. probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life. um. that's about it. think that would made that would've made the biggest difference. in my life i think. um. well i have i have four kids and. i hope i'm raising 'em right i hope that. that um. you know the mistakes that i've made i can kinda guide them. through their their journey in life and i hope that they. end up a little. better for it than. than me. um. yeah i just hope. hope kinda through them. that i can. you know. leave <lea> leave something worthwhile. you're welcome. goodbye.",

you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it. and and resolve it and come to a resolution. um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem. um <sigh>. well a. a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago. um. my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents. and her parents had already left. um eh we were just driving down to. orange country area for this trip. and. my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed. and. but hadn't really. in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had. and so. when i was trying to meet those expectations. she. um. you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted. um and kinda getting attacked for it. so. so then i i i started yelling at her. and. and we you know we had that conflict but then. you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through. and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was. um. are you asking the moment of during the conflict. uh. very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it. in your body. um. part partly i. the i guess the. anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger. so. i would think um. yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger. mm hmm hmm hmm. i guess it was um. deciding to go. um to go to our training last year. um i i felt that god had put on my heart that. that this was something i was supposed to pursue. um my wife didn't feel that way. and. i. i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue. and. but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart. so. i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it. um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um. you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going. uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh. you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do. um. but then after i kinda gave that up. then. um. then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so. um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me. tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory. um. oh let me see. i'm not sure um. i don't know i i can't really. think of anything very traumatic. um that i would wanna erase but i i think. you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda. shape who we are. and. so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase. um usually. usually it's not too bad. um. are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping. um. the the job i work the. the um. kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i. so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts. or graveyard shifts. so. um. coming home in the morning. you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep. but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work. uh it pretty easy. um. when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky. uh. i i've been feeling good lately. no not really. no. no. um. hmm. i don't know um. can't think of anything that was. kinda out of the ordinary. but. um. yesterday. we my wife and i took. took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one. um stayed with her grandma. but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played. and. yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park. um. i i think he'd say i'm a. a family man. that um. i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me. um usually my my friend i end up doing. um. different work around the house for him. 'cause i'm kind of a handyman so. so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice. um. i guess i would um. i guess i would like to be able to. um. start conversations with people. easier. uh sometimes. i have i have trouble. just talking to people. especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them. but kinda talking to people in a group. uh i wish i was a little better at that. now if it's. okay. what what i was gonna say right before that was that um. uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult. uh. advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago. um. probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life. um. that's about it. think that would made that would've made the biggest difference. in my life i think. um. well i have i have four kids and. i hope i'm raising 'em right i hope that. that um. you know the mistakes that i've made i can kinda guide them. through their their journey in life and i hope that they. end up a little. better for it than. than me. um. yeah i just hope. hope kinda through them. that i can. you know. leave <lea> leave something worthwhile. you're welcome. goodbye.",

fine. i was born in texas and i moved to california when i was three and grew up here in california yeah. i was yes. uh i've never been back there. um. don't have any relatives there. don't have a reason to go back there. um. <makes sound with mouth>. <laughter> well my my family's here. that's one uh the weather's great. uh the beaches and mountains are here. all those things are very good. uh the traffic. which is probably <probab> probably most people say. um. it's expensive to live here. those are probably the top two. uh recently i've traveled. um. well you get to see new places and and new people. you get to learn more about other cultures. and uh different ways people think. oh uh at the end of march i went to ecuador for a week. uh. um i spent most of most of one day with. with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got. um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid. trying to. you know say you know what's this what's this. uh it was very humbling. um. you know just just seeing that. you know when you don't when you're not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult. i'm probably more of a shy person. genetics i don't know why. um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction. i've also studied uh computer networking. um. it was. i guess. just uh kinda circumstances. i needed. the. the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family. and. i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain. mm. uh it's given me a lot of opportunity. but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life. well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary. uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall. uh for four years. and last year we we trained in north carolina. for one year. um and that was like theology and bible training. um. basically god put. a um. a desire in my heart to get beyond. get beyond myself and and do something for other people. to to go and. and learn about another people their culture. and to share the gospel with them. well in my immediate family. um. i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters. and then um. but i i have one older brother. uh no sisters. um. so what what do you wanna know about my family. um. i'm really close with my wife and my daughters. uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped. um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old. even though he's he's five years older than me. so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him. but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents. um. i'd say my. my youth pastor in high school. he was a real real positive influence in me. um. just he has a. he has a drive and a zeal for. for pursuing the truth. um. and just uh. studying the bible and. and because of his influence that kinda. put me on a path to wanting to study the bible. um i think i've gotten better at it. there have been. times when. you know i'll i'll get angry. and uh. you know it can just. kinda really rule over me just the frustration. and i'm the type of person that it takes me. um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to. to calm down again. but i've. i've learned um. over time that really getting angry. um and keeping that anger in doesn't. it doesn't. attack the other person or the

'cause obviously i had to support myself. because it was really really boring in oregon so um i really like the activity here in l_a. you know i don't really feel guilty about many things. well i don't talk to them that much um my dad my stepmom live in oregon so i probably talk to 'em on the phone at least once or twice a month. and then when they come out here i wanna say at least once a year sometimes it can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often then i see them. um. that's about it but i'm pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well. yeah.

i'm from los angeles and born in los angeles. yes. uh you have a lot of places to go a lot of people to see a lot of things to do. smog. uh the environmental has changed over the years uh xxx. i've been around since nineteen fifty two and. i was born here in los angeles and i see such changes as far as environmental with the smog. and. mm basically that's about it. i've been to several <s> uh several places in the united states yes. uh trying different type of cuisines uh i like to go to museum like the historical i'm a historical buff i. um. just uh going somewhere different than uh where i've been here all my life. uh let me start with uh. well try boston i had never been to boston before and when i went um i was able to look at the historical uh the buildings and i went to um. uh i saw um. um. eh the lake charles and the and the boats and stuff and it it was just it was a good experience and um. there's another place i went to i took a ferry and it and i my mind went on blank on

they have a lot of. people um i just went on a off season. uh i enjoyed that and i've been to atlanta georgia. and i have taken a cruise. uh i've went to the caribbeans and i took the mexico cruise. uh i my next cruise i'd like to go to is alaska because i want to be able to see uh certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environmental. um i'm outgoing. as far as uh going places i don't have a problem um eating alone. um i don't have a problem meeting people. um i'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger <laughter>. oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that. loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid. i've won a lot of sweepstakes and. uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just. eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me. um. getting married and having my children <laughter>. mm. i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not. and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson. and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner. and the other one is a computer engineer. so and i've been married for thirty three years. and um. basically uh marriage pretty strong. you know what. if you build a foundation with your children. and have a good relationship with them. and talk to 'em and find out what's going on. and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you. and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you. you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door. that you care. and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out. um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem. as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble. and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law. uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you. and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son. and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home. on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey. i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads. so it pays off. and i i basically he treats her well. um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um. for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls. so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel. and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they. found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one. and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel. so i've made up for her. and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there. i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly. so i made up for it. i think before i speak. and then i am the type of person also to um. i take on other people's feelings before i um. blurt out the wrong thing i try to. uh analyze the situation first. before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of. um. <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house. uh we had a disagreement on that um. men have their own way of doing things and um. i had told him not to use a certain uh. eh person to work on our house. but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead. and now he sees all the downfalls. and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so. but i guess he can tell by my facial expression. that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money. and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong. and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project. so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um. that i can think of that's recent. i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me. and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um. you need to do your research. i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's. but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money. and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed. he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>. which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money. and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because. it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again. and it didn't make any sense. um. i retired early. um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california. um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen. and i had like thirty one and a half years of service. and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance. so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but. um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long. um. i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay. um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job. because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um. i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up. and i don't i pay very little money. so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive. um. let me see the hardest. it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying. and my mother um. died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma. and. i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying. or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me. and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx. and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order. and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things. you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and. i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting. she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had. a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything. yeah it was it was but. and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um. since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children. that my husband and i we got together. and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um. what do you call the um. barrel insurance we had that. and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything. and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird. so. my son. make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what. i went through. and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on. and um. he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust. i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call. and that's it. i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well. pretty good. um. i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental. um. exercise walk walking more so. no not really. no. no. i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh. uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them. uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um. thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing. oh uh resource person i've been um. described as a resource person from my supervisor. to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about. i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh. some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place. i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map. yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but. sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff. that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things. and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things. and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it. and that gives me satisfaction. uh. i wish i can uh um. stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and. and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem. and if i can stop binging and making food my friend. um. i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um. but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home. and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so. i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh. not happy with my weight that's it yeah. i'm sorry didn't hear you. um. no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on. um. let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago. mm. i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um. putting away more money before i retire. instead of retiring too early. most proudest is of my life. um. meeting a lot of people that came in my life. uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school. and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together. lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school. group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion. and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh. it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter>. okay. you're welcome. bye bye.",

get out of. um. <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house. uh we had a disagreement on that um. men have their own way of doing things and um. i had told him not to use a certain uh. eh person to work on our house. but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead. and now he sees all the downfalls. and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so. but i guess he can tell by my facial expression. that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money. and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong. and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project. so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um. that i can think of that's recent. i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me. and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um. you need to do your research. i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's. but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money. and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed. he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>. which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money. and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because. it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again. and it didn't make any sense. um. i retired early. um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california. um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen. and i had like thirty one and a half years of service. and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance. so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but. um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long. um. i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay. um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job. because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um. i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up. and i don't i pay very little money. so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive. um. let me see the hardest. it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying. and my mother um. died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma. and. i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying. or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me. and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx. and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order. and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things. you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and. i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting. she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had. a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything. yeah it was it was but. and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um. since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children. that my husband and i we got together. and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um. what do you call the um. barrel insurance we had that. and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything. and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird. so. my son. make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what. i went through. and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on. and um. he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust. i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call. and that's it. i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well. pretty good. um. i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental. um. exercise walk walking more so. no not really. no. no. i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh. uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them. uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um. thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing. oh uh resource person i've been um. described as a resource person from my supervisor. to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about. i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh. some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place. i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map. yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but. sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff. that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things. and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things. and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it. and that gives me satisfaction. uh. i wish i can uh um. stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and. and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem. and if i can stop binging and making food my friend. um. i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um. but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home. and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so. i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh. not happy with my weight that's it yeah. i'm sorry didn't hear you. um. no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on. um. let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago. mm. i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um. putting away more money before i retire. instead of retiring too early. most proudest is of my life. um. meeting a lot of people that came in my life. uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school. and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together. lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school. group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion. and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh. it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter>. okay. you're welcome. bye bye.",

go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that. loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid. i've won a lot of sweepstakes and. uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just. eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before

know what. if you build a foundation with your children. and have a good relationship with them. and talk to 'em and find out what's going on. and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you. and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you. you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they

to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law. uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you. and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son. and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home. on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey. i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads. so it pays off. and i i basically he treats her

eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um. that i can think of that's recent. i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me. and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um. you need to do your research. i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's. but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money. and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed. he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>. which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money. and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because. it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again. and it didn't make any sense. um. i retired early. um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california. um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen. and i had like thirty one and a half years of service. and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance. so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but. um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long. um. i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay. um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job. because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um. i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up. and i don't i pay very little money. so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive. um. let me see the hardest. it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying. and my mother um. died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma. and. i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying. or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me. and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx. and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order. and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things. you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and. i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting. she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had. a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything. yeah it was it was but. and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um. since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children. that my husband and i we got together. and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um. what do you call the um. barrel insurance we had that. and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything. and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird. so. my son. make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what. i went through. and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on. and um. he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust. i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call. and that's it. i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well. pretty good. um. i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental. um. exercise walk walking more so. no not really. no. no. i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh. uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them. uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um. thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing. oh uh resource person i've been um. described as a resource person from my supervisor. to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about. i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh. some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place. i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map. yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but. sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff. that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things. and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things. and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it. and that gives me satisfaction. uh. i wish i can uh um. stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and. and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem. and if i can stop binging and making food my friend. um. i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um. but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home. and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so. i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh. not happy with my weight that's it yeah. i'm sorry didn't hear you. um. no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on. um. let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago. mm. i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um. putting away more money before i retire. instead of retiring too early. most proudest is of my life. um. meeting a lot of people that came in my life. uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school. and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together. lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school. group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion. and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh. it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter>. okay. you're welcome. bye bye.",

to several <s> uh several places in the united states yes. uh trying different type of cuisines uh i like to go to museum like the historical i'm a historical buff i. um. just uh going somewhere different than uh where i've been here all my life. uh let me start with uh. well try boston i had never been to boston before and when i went um i was able to look at the historical uh the buildings and i went to um. uh i saw um. um. eh the lake charles and the and the boats and stuff and it it was just it was a good experience and um. there's another place i went to i took a ferry and it and i

it uh to mardi gras when they have a lot of. people um i just went on a off season. uh i enjoyed that and i've been to atlanta georgia. and i have taken a cruise. uh i've went to the caribbeans and i took the mexico cruise. uh i my next cruise i'd like to go to is alaska because i want to be able to see uh certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environmental. um i'm outgoing. as far as uh going places i don't have a problem um eating alone. um i don't have a problem meeting people. um i'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger <laughter>. oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that. loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid. i've won a lot of sweepstakes and. uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just. eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me. um. getting married and having my children <laughter>. mm. i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not. and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson. and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner. and the other one is a computer engineer. so and i've been married for thirty three years. and um. basically uh marriage pretty strong. you know what. if you build a foundation with your children. and have a good relationship with them. and talk to 'em and find out what's going on. and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you. and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you. you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door. that you care. and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out. um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem. as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble. and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law. uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you. and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son. and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home. on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey. i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads. so it pays off. and i i basically he treats her well. um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um. for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls. so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel. and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they. found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one. and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going

was a lot of money. and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because. it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again. and it didn't make any sense. um. i retired early. um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california. um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen. and i had like thirty one and a half years of service. and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance. so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but. um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long. um. i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay. um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job. because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um. i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up. and i don't i pay very little money. so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive. um. let me see the hardest. it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying. and my mother um. died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma. and. i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying. or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me. and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx. and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order. and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things. you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and. i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting. she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had. a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything. yeah it was it was but. and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um. since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children. that my husband and i we got together. and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um. what do you call the um. barrel insurance we had that. and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything. and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird. so. my son. make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what. i went through. and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on. and um. he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust. i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call. and that's it. i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well. pretty good. um. i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental. um. exercise walk walking more so. no not really. no. no. i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh. uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them. uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um. thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing. oh uh resource person i've been um. described as a resource person from my supervisor. to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about. i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh. some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place. i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map. yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but. sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff. that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things. and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things. and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it. and that gives me satisfaction. uh. i wish i can uh um. stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and. and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem. and if i can stop binging and making food my friend. um. i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um. but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home. and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so. i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh. not happy with my weight that's it yeah. i'm sorry didn't hear you. um. no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on. um. let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago. mm. i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um. putting away more money before i retire. instead of retiring too early. most proudest is of my life. um. meeting a lot of people that came in my life. uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school. and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together. lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school. group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion. and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh. it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter>. okay. you're welcome. bye bye.",

been around since nineteen fifty two and. i was born here in los angeles and i see such changes as far as environmental with the smog. and. mm basically that's about it. i've been to several <s> uh several places in the united states yes. uh trying different type of cuisines uh i like to go to museum like the historical i'm a historical buff i. um. just uh going somewhere different than uh where i've been here all my life. uh let me start with uh. well try boston i had never been to boston before and when i went um i was able to look at the historical uh the buildings and i went to um. uh i saw um. um. eh the lake charles and the and the boats and stuff and it it was just it was a good experience and um. there's another place i went to i took a ferry and it and i my mind went on blank on it um. god. i can't even think of it right now um. but other than that uh new orleans i've been to new orleans i didn't go to the mardi gras it's just i don't like to go and it uh to mardi gras when they have a lot of. people um i just went on a off season. uh i enjoyed that and i've been to atlanta georgia. and i have taken a cruise. uh i've went to the caribbeans and i took the mexico cruise. uh i my next cruise i'd like to go to is alaska because i want to be able to see uh certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environmental. um i'm outgoing. as far as uh going places i don't have a problem um eating alone. um i don't have a problem meeting people. um i'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger <laughter>. oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that. loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid. i've won a lot of sweepstakes and. uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just. eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me. um. getting married and having my children <laughter>. mm. i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not. and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson. and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner. and the other one is a computer engineer. so and i've been married for thirty three years. and um. basically uh marriage pretty strong. you know what. if you build a foundation with your children. and have a good relationship with them. and talk to 'em and find out what's going on. and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you. and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you. you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door. that you care. and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out. um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem. as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble. and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law. uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you. and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son. and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home. on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey. i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads. so it pays off. and i i basically he treats her well. um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um. for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls. so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel. and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they. found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one. and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel. so i've made up for her. and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there. i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly. so i made up for it. i think before i speak. and then i am the type of person also to um. i take on other people's feelings before i um. blurt out the wrong thing i try to. uh analyze the situation first. before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of. um. <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house. uh we had a disagreement on that um. men have their own way of doing things and um. i had told him not to use a certain uh. eh person to work on our house. but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead. and now he sees all the downfalls. and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so. but i guess he can tell by my facial expression. that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money. and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong. and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project. so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um. that i can think of that's recent. i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me. and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um. you need to do your research. i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump

stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay. um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job. because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um. i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up. and i don't i pay very little money. so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive. um. let me see the hardest. it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying. and my mother um. died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma. and. i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying. or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me. and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx. and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order. and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things. you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and. i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting. she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had. a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything. yeah it was it was but. and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um. since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children. that my husband and i we got together. and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um. what do you call the um. barrel insurance we had that. and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything. and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird. so. my son. make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what. i went through. and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on. and um. he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust. i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call. and that's it. i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well. pretty good. um. i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental. um. exercise walk walking more so. no not really. no. no. i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh. uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them. uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um. thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing. oh uh resource person i've been um. described as a resource person from my supervisor. to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about. i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh. some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place. i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map. yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but. sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff. that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things. and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things. and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it. and that gives me satisfaction. uh. i wish i can uh um. stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and. and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem. and if i can stop binging and making food my friend. um. i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um. but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home. and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so. i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh. not happy with my weight that's it yeah. i'm sorry didn't hear you. um. no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on. um. let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago. mm. i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um. putting away more money before i retire. instead of retiring too early. most proudest is of my life. um. meeting a lot of people that came in my life. uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school. and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together. lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school. group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion. and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh. it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter>. okay. you're welcome. bye bye.",

fine. i'm from los angeles and born in los angeles. yes. uh you have a lot of places to go a lot of people to see a lot of things to do. smog. uh the environmental has changed over the years uh xxx. i've been around since nineteen fifty two and. i was born here in los angeles and i see such changes as far as environmental with the smog. and. mm basically that's about it. i've been to several <s> uh several places in the united states yes. uh trying different type of cuisines uh i like to go to museum like the historical i'm a historical buff i. um. just uh going somewhere different than uh where i've been here all my life. uh let me start with uh. well try boston i had never been to boston before and when i went um i was able to look at the historical uh the buildings and i went to um. uh i saw um. um. eh the lake charles and the and the boats and stuff and it it was just it was a good experience and um. there's another place i went to i took a ferry and it and i my mind went on blank on it um. god. i can't even think of it right now um. but other than that uh new orleans i've been to new orleans i didn't go to the mardi gras it's just i don't like to go and it uh to mardi gras when they have a lot of. people um i just went on a off season. uh i enjoyed that and i've been to atlanta georgia. and i have taken a cruise. uh i've went to the caribbeans and i took the mexico cruise. uh i my next cruise i'd like to go to is alaska because i want to be able to see uh certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environmental. um i'm outgoing. as far as uh going places i don't have a problem um eating alone. um i don't have a problem meeting people. um i'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger <laughter>. oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that. loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid. i've won a lot of sweepstakes and. uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just. eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me. um. getting married and having my children <laughter>. mm. i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not. and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson. and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner. and the other one is a computer engineer. so and i've been married for thirty three years. and um. basically uh marriage pretty strong. you know what. if you build a foundation with your children. and have a good relationship with them. and talk to 'em and find out what's going on. and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you. and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you. you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door. that you care. and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out. um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem. as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble. and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law. uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you. and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son. and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home. on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey. i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads. so it pays off. and i i basically he treats her well. um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um. for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls. so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel. and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they. found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one. and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel. so i've made up for her. and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there. i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly. so i made up for it. i think before i speak. and then i am the type of person also to um. i take on other people's feelings before i um. blurt out the wrong thing i try to. uh analyze the situation first. before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of. um. <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house. uh we had a disagreement on that um. men have their own way of doing things and um. i had told him not to use a certain uh. eh person to work on our house. but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead. and now he sees all the downfalls. and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so. but i guess he can tell by my facial expression. that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money. and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong. and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project. so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um. that i can think of that's recent. i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me. and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um. you need to do your research. i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's. but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money. and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed. he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>. which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money. and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because. it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again. and it didn't make any sense. um. i retired early. um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california. um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen. and i had like thirty one and a half years of service. and what was

what do i do xxx. and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order. and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things. you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and. i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting. she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had. a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything. yeah it was it was but. and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um. since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children. that my husband and i we got together. and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um. what do you call the um. barrel insurance we had that. and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything. and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird. so. my son. make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what. i went through. and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on. and um. he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust. i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call. and that's it. i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well. pretty good. um. i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental. um. exercise walk walking more so. no not really. no. no. i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh. uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them. uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um. thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing. oh uh resource person i've been um. described as a resource person from my supervisor. to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about. i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh. some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place. i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map. yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but. sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff. that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things. and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things. and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it. and that gives me satisfaction. uh. i wish i can uh um. stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and. and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem. and if i can stop binging and making food my friend. um. i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um. but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home. and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so. i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh. not happy with my weight that's it yeah. i'm sorry didn't hear you. um. no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on. um. let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago. mm. i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um. putting away more money before i retire. instead of retiring too early. most proudest is of my life. um. meeting a lot of people that came in my life. uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school. and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together. lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school. group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion. and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh. it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter>. okay. you're welcome. bye bye.",

okay other than this laryngitis i have. uh cleveland ohio. in uh. seventy nine i think it was <laughter>. mhm. um. once a year. something like that or less. um uh there's a lot more to do here. um. they're a little more narrow minded. back there and republican <laughter>. um well originally show business. but probably to get away from uh. cleveland. it was very difficult at first. um i'm not used to uh change i don't like change very much you know. having to. uh meet new people and. figure out how to make a living. well. i like. the um different opportunities you have the different the health consciousness. the movies um. the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather. um the driving the congestion. some of the. superficial attitude. the importance mhm. um well not a lot but i do. i just came back from vegas to. visit relatives we met there. and i'm going to mexico. um next month. um. well seeing the different. cultures like been to europe. greece france <p> um italy. um. i like going to places such as mexico where it's gonna be sunny and just lying out i went to last year i went to arizona. i never saw sedona that was really uh. an experience. pure peaceful. about sedona. yeah. well sedona's a very. energetic place and um i thought it was desert like flat. kind of desert looking but it was it's very rocky and when you land in flagstaff there's these beautiful. uh pine trees. and it's the elevation is high and and coming into sedona was very beautiful and. and after a day the pain in my back went away. that i had there for months. so and you had this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had this energy. so it was really um. very mystical. in life <laughter>. or in sedona in life. um. well being on stage in boston. and um that was great i i loved doing that. um. um just being with friends and laughing. are some of my highest moments when we're laughing hysterically. well um. i don't know of a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events. and um. i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and. just laugh and. and. i i can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but. just being with somebody who's in tune with. my sense of humor and uh gets. my jokes and. you know i get his and we're. just um enjoying that moment. um speech and drama. i i majored in. uh no not now. i always was interested in um. musical comedy when i was a child i would. sing along to records in my living room. and i was always in choirs. in school and then when i. uh went to high school i joined the drama club. and i i just always had an interest and i always had a. a big personality and. well <laughter>. um i don't know if i have a dream job anymore. i'm sixty and. i don't know if i. have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything. right now i'd just rather not work <laughter> and just. um. relax and travel but um. i i like being creative. in in any way i can i like independence. and i kind of have that right now so. i'm okay. um. well i i watch my favorite television shows that i've recorded. and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for. um gosh since nineteen eighty eight. and um i'm. a district leader in my community. and we have meetings and that really helps to. center me and bring out my higher self. so if i get tense or nervous i i chant. um sometimes okay sometimes not. a lot yes yes <laughter>. less and less though it's been happening less and less. but um. yeah sometimes it's got it's. it's um. created difficulties. well. i can't <c> <sigh>. i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like. was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving. and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway. about four miles out of our way and i just. i got very angry for about. thirty seconds and then i had to. calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it. so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but. i felt kind of. bad that i overreacted. um. you mean in my life <laughter>. manys. yes. um. gosh there's so many <laughter>. i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing. information. like. they're not gonna use me on a job or something. that i would. take an attitude that. um. i'll find something better it's okay and. move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me. and. you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and. you know that. whole uh. thought process that really doesn't help the situation. and i do that more often. but i. since i started chanting. but it doesn't you know. i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where. i can do that. um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what. television to buy or something <laughter> but um. um. i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences. and um. um. or leaving my  comfort. zone <z> place. if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place. that would be a very difficult decision for me. and probably leaving a relationship. very hard because. you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship. so i usually. live it out til. it's for you know it's. they leave or something you know it's very hard for me. to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on. so what i usually do is i don't make the decision. and i end up suffering. but longer. so. mhm. can we move on. um. well. uh it's hard. because um i don't know if it's because i have pain. in my back. and neck. but. i i it's difficult for me to. stay asleep i'd i i. i don't get a um. a deep sleep. um. but. at because of. uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil. and that's been putting me to sleep so. i have been um. sleeping better because of it. but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell. but before that all happened. i was um. finding it difficult to stay asleep. and so therefore i'm tired during the day and. uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable. but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or. emotional things or or or or not. i'm sorry could you repeat that. have i studied changes in my behavior. uh no <laughter>. i was not. no. mm mm. oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know. well i uh. was going to um. vegas to. meet my family was my. my family was flying in from cleveland to. uh there we have a. a relative in uh vegas. and i drove with my friend. and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday. so. we all went and. had a good time in vegas. i mean i was struggling through my cold but. but it was fun it was nice. well <laughter>. uh they think i'm funny um. they feel that i say it like it is. um. they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so. people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me. 'cause i'll. i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic. but just <ju> that's just the way i talk. so. um my um. the. anger that sometimes wells up in me. you know i just. but although that that really made me i think. a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your. experiences make you who you are. and how you handle them. makes you who you are and if you don't have those. lows you don't really know what highs are. so i don't. i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever. but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today. and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these. moments where i've. just blurt out you know anger or something. i just wish that would happen more less. that the anger parts would happen less. and they are so. i guess it will <laughter>. happen less. um. don't give up hope live in the moment. and um. everything will everything will work out everything will work out. and if you believe that. then you really have nothing to fear. um. the fact that now. and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been. cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become. more um. compassionate person. and i'm able to um. uh. <ss> understand people better. and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too. and. that. if you if you treat people. from that respect that they're. they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because. you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally. and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate. you're you're happy and your life is happy. okay.",

i was um. finding it difficult to stay asleep. and so therefore i'm tired during the day and. uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable. but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or. emotional things or or or or not. i'm sorry could you repeat that. have i studied changes in my behavior. uh no <laughter>. i was not. no. mm mm. oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know. well i uh. was going to um. vegas to. meet my family was my. my family was flying in from cleveland to. uh there we have a. a relative in uh vegas. and i drove with my friend. and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday. so. we all went and. had a good time in vegas. i mean i was struggling through my cold but. but it was fun it was nice. well <laughter>. uh they think i'm funny um. they feel that i say it like it is. um. they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so. people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me. 'cause i'll. i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic. but just <ju> that's just the way i talk. so. um my um. the. anger that sometimes wells up in me. you know i just. but although that that really made me i think. a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your. experiences make you who you are. and how you handle them. makes you who you are and if you don't have those. lows you don't really know what highs are. so i don't. i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever. but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today. and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these. moments where i've. just blurt out you know anger or something. i just wish that would happen more less. that the anger parts would happen less. and they are so. i guess it will <laughter>. happen less. um. don't give up hope live in the moment. and um. everything will everything will work out everything will work out. and if you believe that. then you really have nothing to fear. um. the fact that now. and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been. cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become. more um. compassionate person. and i'm able to um. uh. <ss> understand people better. and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too. and. that. if you if you treat people. from that respect that they're. they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because. you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally. and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate. you're you're happy and your life is happy. okay.",

this laryngitis i have. uh cleveland ohio. in uh. seventy nine i think it was <laughter>. mhm. um. once a year. something like that or less. um uh there's a lot more to do here. um. they're a little more narrow minded. back there and republican <laughter>. um well originally show business. but probably to get away from uh. cleveland. it was very difficult at first. um i'm not used to uh change i don't like change very much you know. having to. uh meet new people and. figure out how to make a living. well. i like. the um different opportunities you have the different the health consciousness. the movies um. the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather. um the driving the congestion. some of the. superficial attitude. the importance mhm. um well not a lot but i do. i just came back from vegas to. visit relatives we met there. and i'm going to mexico. um next month. um. well seeing the different. cultures like been to europe. greece france <p> um italy. um. i like going to places such as mexico where it's gonna be sunny and just lying out i went to last year i went to arizona. i never saw sedona that was really uh. an experience. pure peaceful. about sedona. yeah. well sedona's a very. energetic place and um i thought it was desert like flat. kind of desert looking but it was it's very rocky and when you land in flagstaff there's these beautiful. uh pine trees. and it's the elevation is high and and coming into sedona was very beautiful and. and after a day the pain in my back went away. that i had there for months. so and you had this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had this energy. so it was really um. very mystical. in life <laughter>. or in sedona in life. um. well being on stage in boston. and um that was great i i loved doing that. um. um just being with friends and laughing. are some of my highest moments when we're laughing hysterically. well um. i don't know of a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events. and um. i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and. just laugh and. and. i i can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but. just being with somebody who's in tune with. my sense of humor and uh gets. my jokes and. you know i get his and we're. just um enjoying that moment. um speech and drama. i i majored in. uh no not now. i always was interested in um. musical comedy when i was a child i would. sing along to records in my living room. and i was always in choirs. in school and then when i. uh went to high school i joined the drama club. and i i just always had an interest and i always had a. a big personality and. well <laughter>. um i don't know if i have a dream job anymore. i'm sixty and. i don't know if i. have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything. right now i'd just rather not work <laughter> and just. um. relax and travel but um. i i like being creative. in in any way i can i like independence. and i kind of have that right now so. i'm okay. um. well i i watch my favorite television shows that i've recorded. and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for. um gosh since nineteen eighty eight. and um i'm. a district leader in my community. and we have meetings and that really helps to. center me and bring out my higher self. so if i get tense or nervous i i chant. um sometimes okay sometimes not. a lot yes yes <laughter>. less and less though it's been happening less and less. but um. yeah sometimes it's got it's. it's um. created difficulties. well. i can't <c> <sigh>. i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like. was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving. and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway. about four miles out of our way and i just. i got very angry for about. thirty seconds and then i had to. calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it. so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but. i felt kind of. bad that i overreacted. um. you mean in my life <laughter>. manys. yes. um. gosh there's so many <laughter>. i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing. information. like. they're not gonna use me on a job or something. that i would. take an attitude that. um. i'll find something better it's okay and. move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me. and. you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and. you know that. whole uh. thought process that really doesn't help the situation. and i do that more often. but i. since i started chanting. but it doesn't you know. i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where. i can do that. um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what. television to buy or something <laughter> but um. um. i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences. and um. um. or leaving my  comfort. zone <z> place. if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place. that would be a very difficult decision for me. and probably leaving a relationship. very hard because. you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship. so i usually. live it out til. it's for you know it's. they leave or something you know it's very hard for me. to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on. so what i usually do is i don't make the decision. and i end up suffering. but longer. so. mhm. can we move on. um. well. uh it's hard. because um i don't know if it's because i have pain. in my back. and neck. but. i i it's difficult for me to. stay asleep i'd i i. i don't get a um. a deep sleep. um. but. at because of. uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil. and that's been putting me

more narrow minded. back there and republican <laughter>. um well originally show business. but probably to get away from uh. cleveland. it was very difficult at first. um i'm not used to uh change i don't like change very much you know. having to. uh meet new people and. figure out how to make a living. well. i like. the um different opportunities you have the different the health consciousness. the movies um. the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather. um the driving the congestion. some of the. superficial attitude. the importance mhm. um well not a lot but i do. i just came back from vegas to. visit relatives we met there. and i'm going to mexico. um next month. um. well seeing the different. cultures like been to europe. greece france <p> um italy. um. i like going to places such as mexico where it's gonna be sunny and just lying out i went to last year i went to arizona. i never saw sedona that was really uh. an experience. pure peaceful. about sedona. yeah. well sedona's a very. energetic place and um i thought it was desert like flat. kind of desert looking but it was it's very rocky and when you land in flagstaff there's these beautiful. uh pine trees. and it's the elevation is high and and coming into sedona was very beautiful and. and after a day the pain in my back went away. that i had there for months. so and you had this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had this energy. so it was really um. very mystical. in life <laughter>. or in sedona in life. um. well being on stage in boston. and um that was great i i loved doing that. um. um just being with friends and laughing. are some of my highest moments when we're laughing hysterically. well um. i don't know of a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events. and um. i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and. just laugh and. and. i i can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but. just being with somebody who's in tune with. my sense of humor and uh gets. my jokes and. you know i get his and we're. just um enjoying that moment. um speech and drama. i i majored in. uh no not now. i always was interested in um. musical comedy when i was a child i would. sing along to records in my living room. and i was always in choirs. in school and then when i. uh went to high school i joined the drama club. and i i just always had an interest and i always had a. a big personality and. well <laughter>. um i don't know if i have a dream job anymore. i'm sixty and. i don't know if i. have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything. right now i'd just rather not work <laughter> and just. um. relax and travel but um. i i like being creative. in in any way i can i like independence. and i kind of have that right now so. i'm okay. um. well i i watch my favorite television shows that i've recorded. and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for. um gosh since nineteen eighty eight. and um i'm. a district leader in my community. and we have meetings and that really helps to. center me and bring out my higher self. so if i get tense or nervous i i chant. um sometimes okay sometimes not. a lot yes yes <laughter>. less and less though it's been happening less and less. but um. yeah sometimes it's got it's. it's um. created difficulties. well. i can't <c> <sigh>. i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like. was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving. and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway. about four miles out of our way and i just. i got very angry for about. thirty seconds and then i had to. calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it. so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but. i felt kind of. bad that i overreacted. um. you mean in my life <laughter>. manys. yes. um. gosh there's so many <laughter>. i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing. information. like. they're not gonna use me on a job or something. that i would. take an attitude that. um. i'll find something better it's okay and. move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me. and. you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and. you know that. whole uh. thought process that really doesn't help the situation. and i do that more often. but i. since i started chanting. but it doesn't you know. i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where. i can do that. um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what. television to buy or something <laughter> but um. um. i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences. and um. um. or leaving my  comfort. zone <z> place. if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place. that would be a very difficult decision for me. and probably leaving a relationship. very hard because. you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship. so i usually. live it out til. it's for you know it's. they leave or something you know it's very hard for me. to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on. so what i usually do is i don't make the decision. and i end up suffering. but longer. so. mhm. can we move on. um. well. uh it's hard. because um i don't know if it's because i have pain. in my back. and neck. but. i i it's difficult for me to. stay asleep i'd i i. i don't get a um. a deep sleep. um. but. at because of. uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil. and that's been putting me to sleep so. i have been um. sleeping better because of it. but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell. but before that all happened. i was um. finding it difficult to stay asleep. and so therefore i'm tired during the day and. uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable. but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or. emotional things or or or or not. i'm sorry could you repeat that. have i studied changes in my behavior. uh no <laughter>. i was not. no. mm mm. oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know. well i uh. was going to um. vegas to. meet my family was my. my family was flying in from cleveland to. uh there we have a. a relative in uh vegas. and i drove with my friend. and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday. so. we all went and. had a good time in vegas. i mean i was struggling through my cold but. but it was fun it was nice. well <laughter>. uh they think i'm funny um. they feel that i say it like it is. um. they

little more narrow minded. back there and republican <laughter>. um well originally show business. but probably to get away from uh. cleveland. it was very difficult at first. um i'm not used to uh change i don't like change very much you know. having to. uh meet new people and. figure out how to make a living. well. i like. the um different opportunities you have the different the health consciousness. the movies um. the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather. um the driving the congestion. some of the. superficial attitude. the importance mhm. um well not a lot but i do. i just came back from vegas to. visit relatives we met there. and i'm going to mexico. um next month. um. well seeing the different. cultures like been to europe. greece france <p> um italy. um. i like going to places such as mexico where it's gonna be sunny and just lying out i went to last year i went to arizona. i never saw sedona that was really uh. an experience. pure peaceful. about sedona. yeah. well sedona's a very. energetic place and um i thought it was desert like flat. kind of desert looking but it was it's very rocky and when you land in flagstaff there's these beautiful. uh pine trees. and it's the elevation is high and and coming into sedona was very beautiful and. and after a day the pain in my back went away. that i had there for months. so and you had this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had this energy. so it was really um. very mystical. in life <laughter>. or in sedona in life. um. well being on stage in boston. and um that was great i i loved doing that. um. um just being with friends and laughing. are some of my highest moments when we're laughing hysterically. well um. i don't know of a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events. and um. i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and. just laugh and. and. i i can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but. just being with somebody who's in tune with. my sense of humor and uh gets. my jokes and. you know i get his and we're. just um enjoying that moment. um speech and drama. i i majored in. uh no not now. i always was interested in um. musical comedy when i was a child i would. sing along to records in my living room. and i was always in choirs. in school and then when i. uh went to high school i joined the drama club. and i i just always had an interest and i always had a. a big personality and. well <laughter>. um i don't know if i have a dream job anymore. i'm sixty and. i don't know if i. have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything. right now i'd just rather not work <laughter> and just. um. relax and travel but um. i i like being creative. in in any way i can i like independence. and i kind of have that right now so. i'm okay. um. well i i watch my favorite television shows that i've recorded. and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for. um gosh since nineteen eighty eight. and um i'm. a district leader in my community. and we have meetings and that really helps to. center me and bring out my higher self. so if i get tense or nervous i i chant. um sometimes okay sometimes not. a lot yes yes <laughter>. less and less though it's been happening less and less. but um. yeah sometimes it's got it's. it's um. created difficulties. well. i can't <c> <sigh>. i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like. was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving. and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway. about four miles out of our way and i just. i got very angry for about. thirty seconds and then i had to. calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it. so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but. i felt kind of. bad that i overreacted. um. you mean in my life <laughter>. manys. yes. um. gosh there's so many <laughter>. i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing. information. like. they're not gonna use me on a job or something. that i would. take an attitude that. um. i'll find something better it's okay and. move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me. and. you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and. you know that. whole uh. thought process that really doesn't help the situation. and i do that more often. but i. since i started chanting. but it doesn't you know. i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where. i can do that. um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what. television to buy or something <laughter> but um. um. i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences. and um. um. or leaving my  comfort. zone <z> place. if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place. that would be a very difficult decision for me. and probably leaving a relationship. very hard because. you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship. so i usually. live it out til. it's for you know it's. they leave or something you know it's very hard for me. to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on. so what i usually do is i don't make the decision. and i end up suffering. but longer. so. mhm. can we move on. um. well. uh it's hard. because um i don't know if it's because i have pain. in my back. and neck. but. i i it's difficult for me to. stay asleep i'd i i. i don't get a um. a deep sleep. um. but. at because of. uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil. and that's been putting me to sleep so. i have been um. sleeping better because of it. but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell. but before that all happened. i was um. finding it difficult to stay asleep. and so therefore i'm tired during the day and. uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable. but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or. emotional things or or or or not. i'm sorry could you repeat that. have i studied changes in my behavior. uh no <laughter>. i was not. no. mm mm. oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know. well i uh. was going to um. vegas to. meet my family was my. my family was flying in from cleveland to. uh there we have a. a relative in uh vegas. and i drove with my friend. and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday. so. we all went and. had a good time in vegas. i mean i was struggling through my cold but. but it was fun it was nice. well <laughter>. uh they think i'm funny um. they feel that i say it like it is. um. they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so. people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me. 'cause i'll. i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic. but just <ju> that's just the way i talk. so. um my um. the. anger that sometimes wells up in me. you know i just. but although that that really made me i think. a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your. experiences make you who you are. and how you handle them. makes you who you are and if you don't have those. lows you don't really know what highs are. so i don't. i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever. but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today. and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these. moments where i've. just blurt out you know anger or something. i just wish that would happen more less. that the anger parts would happen less. and they are so. i guess it will <laughter>. happen less. um. don't give up hope live in the moment. and um. everything will everything will work out everything will work out. and if you believe that. then you really have nothing to fear. um. the fact that now. and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been. cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become. more um. compassionate person. and i'm able to um. uh. <ss> understand people better. and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too. and. that. if you if you treat people. from that respect that they're. they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because. you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally. and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate. you're you're happy and your life is happy. okay.",

i'm okay. i grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a bit and then i lived overseas for a little while then i moved to california. mhm. i moved here at the end of june of last year so i guess it's been what eight months something like that. um <sigh>. at the most probably twice a year. <laughter> well my hometown is uh all of five thousand people  and um there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of l_a <laughter>. um <sigh> it's a good question i i've always wanted to live in california so but i had been living in in the central coast um. and. i just had been coming down to l_a like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so. um yeah things were were changing. in santa cruz for me the client i had who was really the main like financial. um. main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess i'll give l_a a try and see what happens so. so i gave it a shot and here i am. oh not at all <laughter> it's a very very big city um. i lived in dublin in ireland it was a which is also a big city but. you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy um. and. yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and uh. yeah. so. <sigh>. <laughter>. i love to travel i love it yeah i've i i lived in ireland and i traveled um. i was in morocco and i was in costa rica. um i've spent some time in mexico so. yeah. um i love <sigh> meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also. not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go. um sure well. i guess hmm. i'm trying to think which was my favorite i mean eh there was amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but. morocco was incredible it was like twelve days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains which are beautiful and uh. yeah it's a really really cool culture so it was fun. um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so. my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was. um being on a bus and and leaving. um dublin and going just out to the countryside and. seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but. when you actually get there and experience it it's it like the pictures don't do it justice so it was incredible. yeah. um i have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women studies. no i use my english and psychology um i work in marketing communications so. i actually do sales. so um yeah the psychology definitely comes into. comes into play and eh so does my. i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach. um. to. guess i'm not clear on the question um. okay. <laughter>. wow um <sigh>. you know my dream job is. being a. a motivational speaker and trainer and coach. um and traveling the world doing that and and impacting people's lives and. um really contributing to people. um my relationship's pretty good actually i. i just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would. not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and. um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got  in communication with my biological mother. um last may and we've been. we've you know cleared things up and have been in communication since then so. um. <mutters>. well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother. um. i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so. yeah. i'm shy. <laughter>. <laughter>. um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i don't have the money for it right now um i love to dance. i love to read. i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else. um. i like to be with friends um. i love art and. trying new restaurants um. yeah all those things are. both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that. um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so. yeah yeah. um depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter>. um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be. oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery. yeah that was the last time so. yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of. uh it didn't show up. and. uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until. um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and. they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place. so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that. the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so. i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated. oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um. let me think about one. um the other day i had a phone call. and i'm in a coaching program and. it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program. and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with. and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with. um. someone who's not my coach and uh that. hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these. people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to. not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know. so. yeah i wasn't um. i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and. it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but. um. yeah i could've. certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and. would've made the call go a lot smoother. hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few. i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision. no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was. challenging. um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i. moved. uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado. and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been. you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know. um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging. oh lots of things um. i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and. the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um. at the time i was very much into rock climbing. and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were. um in my age group and or single that was another factor um. and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit. so. yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but. um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move. yeah. uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh>. relatively easily. it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then. you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today. but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty. anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um. but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of. out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um. yeah and i just i have to find. the financial means to support me in doing that and it's. and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing. so. yeah. um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation. um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can. there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do. and mm my money's not working at all. so yeah it feels pretty crappy. <laughter> thanks. i have in the past yeah. oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago. i was suicidal. oh yeah i feel down mhm. i don't actually no. um. well i originally stopped. with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had. worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed. and um and then i began therapy again. later on. think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties. um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so. yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous. i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see. and. you know work through that situation and come up with um. a strategy for. not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies. and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. <deep breath> <sigh> the last time i felt really happy <sigh> wow. huh. wow that's pretty sad. um it was at least a year ago. no i that's not true it was. when i um. saw my biological mother which was last may. my best qualities. um <sigh>. i'm very strong. very strong-willed. i um. am very supportive and loving and nurturing. um. i'm easy to be around. i'm intelligent. and. um. yeah. anything i regret. i don't think so. no. <sigh> don't take life too seriously. <laughter>. oh my ideal weekend. um i spend some time at the beach i'll spend some time with friends. um either going out at night you know to a movie or. just going out to um. a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. um maybe go dancing after. um and sundays i usually go to. scrubbed_entry. and then i have brunch with friends and. um. yeah i go home and sunday night i get ready for the next day so. hmm <sigh>. i am most proud of. um. a few things i mean. i've moved to places that i wanted to move to. and uh so i've done things that have really spoken to me and have. meant something you know been dear to my heart to actually. um. mm achieve those those um. goals or those. yeah i've done things that i've wanted to do like move to ireland and move to california. mhm. okay. sure. bye.",

um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i. moved. uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado. and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been. you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know. um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging. oh lots of things um. i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and. the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um. at the time i was very much into rock climbing. and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were. um in my age group and or single that was another factor um.

been a few. i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision. no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was. challenging. um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i. moved. uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado. and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been. you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know. um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride

had. worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed. and um and then i began therapy again. later on. think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties. um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so. yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous. i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't

was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated. oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um. let me think about one. um the other day i had a phone call. and i'm in a coaching program and. it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program. and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with. and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with. um. someone who's not my coach and uh that. hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these. people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to. not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know. so. yeah i wasn't um. i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and. it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but. um. yeah i could've. certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and. would've made the call go a lot smoother. hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few. i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision. no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was. challenging. um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i. moved. uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado. and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been. you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know. um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging. oh lots of things um. i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and. the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um. at the time i was very much into rock climbing. and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were. um in my age group and or single that was another factor um. and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit. so. yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but. um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move. yeah. uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh>. relatively easily. it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then. you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today. but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty. anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um. but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of. out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um. yeah and i just i have to find. the financial means to support me in doing that and it's. and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing. so. yeah. um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation. um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can. there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do. and mm my money's not working at all. so yeah it feels pretty crappy. <laughter> thanks. i have in the past yeah. oh a long time i was fifteen i

to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of. uh it didn't show up. and. uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until. um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and. they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place. so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that. the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so. i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated. oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um. let me think about one. um the other day i had a phone call. and i'm in a coaching program and. it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program. and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with. and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with. um. someone who's not my coach and uh that. hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these. people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to. not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know. so. yeah i wasn't um. i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and. it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but. um. yeah i could've. certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and. would've made the call go a lot smoother. hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few. i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision. no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was. challenging. um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i. moved. uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado. and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been. you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know. um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging. oh lots of things um. i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and. the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um. at the time i was very much into rock climbing. and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were. um in my age group and or single that was another factor um. and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit. so. yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but. um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move. yeah. uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh>. relatively easily. it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then. you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today. but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty. anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um. but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of. out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um. yeah and i just i have to find. the financial means to support me in doing that and it's. and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing. so. yeah. um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation. um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can. there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do. and mm my money's not working at all. so yeah it feels pretty crappy. <laughter> thanks. i have in the past yeah. oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago. i was suicidal. oh yeah i feel down mhm. i don't actually no. um. well i originally stopped. with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had. worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed. and um and then i began therapy again. later on. think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties. um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so. yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous. i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see. and. you know work through that situation and come up with um. a strategy for. not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies. and uh tools for the rest

no i use my english and psychology um i work in marketing communications so. i actually do sales. so um yeah the psychology definitely comes into. comes into play and eh so does my. i guess my

i'm not clear on the question um. okay. <laughter>. wow um <sigh>. you know my dream job is. being a. a motivational speaker and trainer and coach. um and traveling the world doing that and and

was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated. oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um. let me think about one. um the other day i had a phone call. and i'm in a coaching program and. it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program. and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with. and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with. um. someone who's not my coach and uh that. hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these. people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to. not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know. so. yeah i wasn't um. i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and. it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but. um. yeah i could've. certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and. would've made the call go a lot smoother. hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few. i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision. no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was. challenging. um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i. moved. uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado. and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been. you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know. um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging. oh lots of things um. i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and. the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um. at the time i was very much into rock climbing. and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were. um in my age group and or single that was another factor um. and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit. so. yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but. um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move. yeah. uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh>. relatively easily. it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then. you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today. but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty. anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um. but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of. out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um. yeah and i just i have to find. the financial means to support me in doing that and it's. and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing. so. yeah. um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation. um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can. there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do. and mm my money's not working at all. so yeah it feels pretty crappy. <laughter> thanks. i have in the past yeah. oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago. i was suicidal. oh yeah i feel down mhm. i don't actually no. um. well i originally stopped. with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had. worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed. and um and then i began therapy again. later on. think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties. um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so. yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous. i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see. and. you know work through that situation and come up with um. a strategy for. not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies. and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. <deep breath> <sigh> the last time i felt really happy <sigh> wow. huh. wow that's pretty sad. um it was at least a year ago. no i that's not true it was. when i um. saw my biological mother which was last may. my best qualities. um <sigh>. i'm very strong. very strong-willed. i um. am very supportive and loving and nurturing. um. i'm easy to be around. i'm intelligent. and. um. yeah. anything i regret. i don't think so. no. <sigh> don't take life too seriously. <laughter>. oh my ideal weekend. um i spend some time at the beach i'll spend some time with friends. um either going out at night you know to a movie or. just going out to um. a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. um maybe go dancing after. um and sundays i usually go to. scrubbed_entry. and then i have brunch with friends and. um. yeah i go home and sunday night i get ready for the next day so. hmm <sigh>. i am most proud

have all these. people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to. not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know. so. yeah i wasn't um. i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and. it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but. um. yeah i could've. certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and. would've made the call go a lot smoother. hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few. i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision. no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was. challenging. um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i. moved. uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado. and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been. you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know. um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging. oh lots of things um. i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and. the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um. at the time i was very much into rock climbing. and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were. um in my age group and or single that was another factor um. and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit. so. yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but. um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move. yeah. uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh>. relatively easily. it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then. you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today. but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty. anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um. but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of. out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um. yeah and i just i have to find. the financial means to support me in doing that and it's. and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing. so. yeah. um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation. um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can. there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do. and mm my money's not working at all. so yeah it feels pretty crappy. <laughter> thanks. i have in the past yeah. oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago. i was suicidal. oh yeah i feel down mhm. i don't actually no. um. well i originally stopped. with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had. worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed. and um and then i began therapy again. later on. think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties. um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so. yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous. i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see. and. you know work through that situation and come up with um. a strategy for. not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies. and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. <deep breath> <sigh> the last time i felt really happy <sigh> wow. huh. wow that's pretty sad. um it was at least a year ago. no i that's not true it was. when i um. saw my biological mother which was last may. my best qualities. um <sigh>. i'm very strong. very strong-willed. i um. am very supportive and loving and nurturing. um. i'm easy to be around. i'm intelligent. and. um. yeah. anything i regret. i don't think so. no. <sigh> don't take life too seriously. <laughter>. oh my ideal weekend. um i spend some time at the beach i'll spend some time with friends. um either going out at night you know to a movie or. just going out to um. a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. um maybe go dancing after. um and sundays i usually go to. scrubbed_entry. and then i have brunch with friends and. um. yeah i go home and sunday night i get ready for the next day so. hmm <sigh>. i am most proud of. um. a few things i mean. i've moved to places that i wanted to move to. and uh so i've done things that have really spoken to me and have. meant something you know been dear to my heart to actually. um. mm achieve those those um. goals or those. yeah i've done things that i've wanted to do like move to ireland and move to california. mhm. okay. sure. bye.",

made. like mistakes sometimes but i think that she was always there for me when i needed it. and um she just did her best to raise me so. i think she was a big positive influence. uh it's been easy

<laughter>. um. i regret not doing better uh when i was in high school. um. uh. i mean not getting better grades. um. i regret uh. like getting involved with certain people in the past. but i mean i don't i'm not sure <laughter>. that's about it that i can think of right now <laughter>. hm. um. uh yeah i mean i mean in the past. uh yeah i could've made. different decisions. i mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but i'm not going to feel i'm not going to regret things that i had no power over so. um. i'm not sure if i would want to erase it from my memory. but. i wish that it didn't happen to me uh was uh the time that i was raped. <laughter> i can't really think of any hard decisions um. hm. i can't think of any <laughter>. hm. i'm not sure <laughter> i can't think of any. uh i have a pretty good relationship with my family um. uh not. i wouldn't say that i'm really close with my mother but i mean we get along well. and i'm very close with my sister we're basically best friends. um. hm. i think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life. uh. because she was always able to provide for me and she always. she didn't i mean she made. like mistakes sometimes but i think that she was always there for me when i needed it. and um she just did her best to raise me so. i think she was a big positive influence. uh it's been easy lately. uh sometimes i have trouble sleeping but uh. lately i have had no problems. um. it depends how long i've gone without sleep i can just. be anywhere from like. groggy to like um. really on edge. and like um. extremely tired <laughter> i don't know. um i have been feeling. pretty good i uh. i have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been. in the past. so. been feeling mostly pretty good. um i think that i've actually been feeling. happier lately. i wouldn't say that i'm like really happy all the time i mostly just kind of. like. um. neutral but i have been feeling. more positive lately. i'm actually not sure if i've been diagnosed with p_t_s_d. um. uh. i know that i i've been seeing uh psychologist <psyc> psychologists for like. since i was sixteen. um for depression. and uh i think my first psychologist who i saw for a few years. thought that i had p_t_s_d but i'm not sure if she. ever made a diagnosis. um. i'm not sure <laughter>. uh. i'm <laughter> i don't know. yes. um. it's helpful to uh. talk someone and have them kind of. um. guide you in. talking about something so that you can figure thing the figure out your. feelings about things sort of i guess for yourself or like why it it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something. i mean. i think sometimes you can do that on your own but. uh. talking to somebody helps i think. um. hm. i'm not sure <laughter>. um. i'm not sure <laughter>. um. i'm not sure <laughter>. uh. i think i would spend it mostly. at home. um but it would be sunny out and i would go outside a little bit. and i'd play with my dogs and. uh. i'd probably have my boyfriend over. um. i'd eat food that i like. like only food that i like like my favorite foods um. watch. movie or t_v show that i like. um. just. kind of have like a relaxing time but. that's nice. mm. i would tell myself to uh. to uh to do better in school because throughout high school i was kind of an underachiever. and i ended up going to community college like on and off because i would like. sort of lose interest and then. uh not do well. or as well as i could have. so i would tell myself to. do as well as i could in school because i feel like i am capable of a lot more. than i do. and i think i could easily have gotten a scholarship <schol> a scholarship if i had done well in high school. so i would just tell myself to do good in school. probably warn myself about one or two people that. turned out to be not worth my time <laughter>. um. hm. um. i think i am. proud of myself for not. being um. bitter and for wanting. to. uh. well i am kind of bitter i guess but i guess i'm proud of myself. for not being selfish and wanting to. um make the world a better place like 'cause a lot of bad things have happened to me and i try to instead instead of dwell on them. i try to. um. or i want. to be able to make things better for other people. and as much

little bit of both but um i'm pretty outgoing. um well speaking of hawaii i did uh live there for a year and a half but what do i do to relax is either um usually take a nap <laughter>. um take a bath. um or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways. um it needs to be worked on but um. i know when to control it. um when i need to. um. well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments um it was just over a text message but. um actually it was my fault but um usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control but. um that's usually how it goes <laughter>. um. well. i xxx don't know what else to do except for pray on it because i thought once i moved into another house it would be over but i see that we're still getting into it. so um i don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right then let him be right i guess. um. probably quite a few things but i don't regret anything i've done in my life but um. situation i wish i would've handled differently um just. kind of everything in my life almost <laughter> i could've done it differently or i would if i had the chance but i'm not worried about it 'cause i don't regret anything that i've done in my life. the hardest decision um probably when i had to get a divorce that. mm that may have been the hardest or one of the hardest decisions. um it was just a lot of um. a lot of stuff through the years um <clears throat> the relationship had kind of deteriorated um. if the relationship. between us was still good. then the things that he were doing um. i would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because um i've i would feel like well our relationship is good and. it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and. problems financial problems and he's doing this so um. i just decided just forget it i mean i tried but. eh you know he didn't wanna cooperate so. um. well i'm happy with what's going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yes. um. something i can erase um. mm i don't think i really need to erase anything um. i've finally gotten over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that i can't think of anything to erase. um it's fair slash good um there's no problems right now so i guess i'll just say good yeah there's no problems. um well i would have to say my mother. yes. um well she's just always supported me and. everything that i've done um whether it's. good or not so good so um i think that's a blessing. mhm. um sometimes sometime it's not. um well i just don't get enough hours of sleep i guess that's what it is as i would like to um sometimes. so um that's more the problem i would like to get. mhm. um just sleepy <sigh> yeah sleepy tired feeling like i wanna go take a nap. um i've been feeling fine. mhm. uh no they've been about the same. no. no. um really happy uh probably last week because i got over to a little bit of money so <laughter>. um well i guess my best friend would be my mom or maybe my um entertainment friend that i've been knowing since ninety six. i really wouldn't. i'm not gonna say i don't consider him a best friend but we don't really hang out that much but he is very um generous to me and my mom. mhm. so. um. well right now i spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in. but maybe after the classwork is out of the way um <laughter> maybe i can do something else. uh myself well i do wish that um. at times i could control my temper a little more and um of course i would like to lose weight. um be a little bit more active and um i wish my skin would clear up. um it was probably when i was in school um school years are terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals. so um they try to make you feel like um you're nothing like you're. piece of dirt under their foot so that's probably the last time as an adult no. um i would say that i'm genuine um i'm honest um i'm supportive. and um i'm just a good friend. no. um well uh twenty years ago um. just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like um people tell you. <laughter> um that's the main thing um i'm going to tell my daughters no. um just eat as you normally eat but eat more healthier um there's no need to gain eighty pounds when. the baby is just twenty pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose. um also if i came into any money now twenty years ago i was probably just thinking about shopping or um. just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff whereas now i would um invest it. um so yeah i think that's about it <laughter>. um proud of uh <sigh>. mm i guess maybe myself um. my kids. k thank you. bye.",

think a lot . um about the things that stress me out . um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um . yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks . um . i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh . has affected me throughout the years so um . it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt   . um . or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep . but i uh <sigh>. i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me . because of stuff that've happened to me . so um . i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well . um . tired . i'm uh . i'm moody i'm very sensitive . um . i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person . um which really that's not me um . i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is

um if i have make appointments i uh . i make appointments to like for auditions or or um . even to do this i um i i tend to uh . just not . like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways  . yes . um i've been diagnosed for two instances . um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago . and then i was diagnosed again um in august. um . the first time it was um . i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um  . and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress . um . and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um . and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore . so i i figured um . i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um . not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated . yeah . it was . i no <n> do not. um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um . get out of my environment . um. and uh . and that seemed to help a lot . um . and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much . um they just . they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed . um . yeah so um . yeah . <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why  . um . but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um  . keeping myself busy . um . actually um . i'm kind of. a couple days ago . i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy  . um but then i went back to . being you know going back to feeling miserable . so. um . well i realized . i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep . and um . i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky . um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me . and uh . you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that . and that made me really happy . um . yeah . thank you <laughter>. oh geez. um . i've had so many years of just . just bad just a lot of bad . that it there has it's been a long time . since i've been proud of anything . i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through . um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've . gotten rid of themselves a long time ago . but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um . there's gotta be a silver lining . so . um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh . i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people . and um . and truthful and i still i still have drive in me . yeah . ugh <sigh> so much um . my last marriage. um not getting out when i should have . um . and uh just. i regret a lot. <sigh>. um the any situation that would've had a red flag um . eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work. and um . no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um . i i would tell myself um to um . that it's not selfish . to let go of a bad situation . and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself . so if. had i known that then had had i known that. then i i i probably would've done better in life. so . yeah . <sigh>. um. people who um . when people are down on me for my faults . um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um . people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy. um. just anybody who picks on the little guy . um . you know people who don't care about the environment or animals. um . i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be . and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do . and uh i that makes me mad . <laughter> i vent <laughter> um . yeah i tend to vent and then uh . and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um. i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore. mm. i try not to get angry um . because i have a really bad temper. and it um . and it can get outta hand so um . what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap.  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind. and come back to it . um . it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um . it was about um . actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her . and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um . i was i was tired um i was it was late and um . i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um . and you <yo> <sigh>. it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person  . um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue . mm kinda petty and stupid but . at the time it it seemed . it seemed uh . viable . um . hmm. one of my most memorable experiences . um . god <go> i've had so many um . maybe. it was um . i don't know. um . it was . probably um . graduating pharmacy school . um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing . uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent . and um . i uh . i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um . and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah . yeah . um . i'm reliable . um . i um . i'm talented . um i. i'm a good listener. um . i'm always there to help people . um . i tend to always try to do the right thing . um . sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but . um . and just . i uh . all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself. um . yeah . um . going to comedy shows . um . just um . having moments where you just laugh with people . um . sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood. uh . i don't know. probably that's about it . uh huh . okay . thank you . bye.",

that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much . um they just . they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed . um . yeah so um . yeah . <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why  . um . but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um  . keeping myself busy . um . actually um . i'm kind of. a couple days ago . i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy  . um but then i went back to . being you know going back to feeling miserable . so. um . well i realized . i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep . and um . i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky . um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me . and uh . you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that . and that made me really happy . um . yeah . thank you <laughter>. oh geez. um . i've had so many years of just . just bad just a lot of bad . that it there has it's been a long time . since i've been proud of anything . i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through . um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've . gotten rid of themselves a long time ago . but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um . there's gotta be a silver lining . so . um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh . i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people . and um . and truthful and i still i still have drive in me . yeah . ugh <sigh> so much um . my last marriage. um not getting out when i should have . um . and uh just. i regret a lot. <sigh>. um the any situation that would've had a red flag um . eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work. and um . no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um . i i would tell myself um to um . that it's not selfish . to let go of a bad situation . and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself . so if. had i known that then had had i known that. then i i i probably would've done better in life. so . yeah . <sigh>. um. people who um . when people are down on me for my faults . um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people

it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do . and uh i that makes me mad . <laughter> i vent <laughter> um . yeah i tend to vent and then uh . and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um. i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore. mm. i try not to get angry um . because i have a really bad temper. and it um . and it can get outta hand so um . what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap.  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind. and come back to it . um . it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um . it was about um . actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her . and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um . i was i was tired um i was it was late and um . i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um . and you <yo> <sigh>. it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person  . um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue . mm kinda petty and stupid but . at the time it it seemed . it seemed uh . viable . um . hmm. one of my most

uh . uh it was beautiful for what i got to see but really . it wasn't really much to it <laughter> . yeah . um . both i'm both an introvert and an extrovert . um . i really enjoy doing things by myself . um . i um have a lot of my own um my likes and dislikes and i've spent a lot of time alone even though um i have <ha> i do have a lot of friends. and uh when i do go out i i do tend to meet a lot of people but um i also enjoy um being by myself a lot . um . probably outgoing creative. um . talented . um fun trustworthy . um . i studied language um . and um physics . and um . math. no i'm not . i'm actually um. i'm um i'm trying to be an actress . it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager . scrubbed_entry. and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it for years um . so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing  . um so far um i just got picked up by an agent . so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult . but um . i'm hoping . hoping something it'll be fruitful  . um . <sigh> i really don't haven't had too many . um . i guess my sister she's done really well . um . my boyfriend he's a . he's a very positive human being . um . but um . really i haven't had too many positive influences . um . i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything . um they're kind of judgmental . but um . other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day . um . geez. um . it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v. um and i read . a lot um . that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um . yeah it's kinda it's xxx like i said it's really hard for me to relax . um . it isn't . um i tend to think a lot . um about the things that stress me out . um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um . yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks . um . i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh . has affected me throughout the years so um . it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt   . um . or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep . but i uh <sigh>. i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me . because of stuff that've happened to me . so um . i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well . um . tired . i'm uh . i'm moody i'm very sensitive . um . i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person . um which really that's not me um . i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just . i'm just not a not a nice person to be around . um . i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um . just to keep myself involved . um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can . um by running around and and and doing things . so . um it's difficult . um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna . i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh . i make appointments to like for auditions or or um . even to do this i um i i tend to uh . just not . like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways  . yes . um i've been diagnosed for two instances . um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago . and then i was diagnosed again um in august. um . the first time it was um . i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um  . and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress . um . and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um . and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore . so i i figured um . i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um . not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated . yeah . it was . i no <n> do not. um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um . get out of my environment . um. and uh . and that seemed to help a lot . um . and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much . um they just . they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed . um . yeah so um . yeah . <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why  . um . but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um  . keeping myself busy . um . actually um . i'm kind of. a couple days ago . i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy  . um but then i went back to . being you know going back to feeling miserable . so. um . well i realized . i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep . and um . i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky . um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me . and uh . you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that . and that made me really happy . um . yeah . thank you <laughter>. oh geez. um . i've had so many years of just . just bad just a lot of bad . that it there has it's been a long time . since i've been proud of anything . i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through . um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've . gotten rid of themselves a long time ago . but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um . there's gotta be a silver lining . so . um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh . i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people . and um . and truthful and i still i still have drive in me . yeah . ugh <sigh> so much um . my last marriage. um not getting out when i should have . um . and uh just. i regret a lot. <sigh>. um the any situation that would've had a red flag um . eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work. and um . no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um . i i would tell myself um to um . that it's not selfish . to let go of a bad situation . and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself . so if. had i known that then had had i known that. then i i i probably would've done better in life. so . yeah . <sigh>. um. people who um . when people are down on me for my faults . um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um . people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy. um. just anybody who picks on the little guy . um . you know people who don't care about the environment or animals. um . i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be . and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do . and uh i that makes me mad . <laughter> i vent <laughter> um . yeah i tend to vent and then uh . and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um. i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore. mm. i try not to get angry um . because i have a really bad temper. and it um . and it can get outta hand so um . what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap.  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind. and come back to it . um . it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um . it was about um . actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her . and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um . i was i was tired um i was it was late and um . i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um . and you <yo> <sigh>. it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person  . um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue . mm kinda petty and stupid but . at the time it it seemed . it seemed uh . viable . um . hmm. one of my most memorable experiences . um . god <go> i've had so many um . maybe. it was um . i don't know. um . it was . probably um . graduating pharmacy school . um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing . uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent . and um . i uh . i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um . and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah . yeah . um . i'm reliable . um . i um . i'm talented . um i. i'm a good listener. um . i'm always there to help people . um . i tend to always try to do the right thing . um . sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but . um . and just . i uh . all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself. um . yeah . um . going to comedy shows . um . just um . having moments where you just laugh with people . um . sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood. uh . i don't know.

all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks . um . i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh . has affected me throughout the years so um . it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt   . um . or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep . but i uh <sigh>. i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me . because of stuff that've happened to me . so um . i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well . um . tired . i'm uh . i'm moody i'm very sensitive . um . i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person . um which really that's not me um . i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is

um if i have make appointments i uh . i make appointments to like for auditions or or um . even to do this i um i i tend to uh . just not . like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways  . yes . um i've been diagnosed for two instances . um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago . and then i was diagnosed again um in august. um . the first time it was um . i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um  . and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress . um . and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um . and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore . so i i figured um . i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um . not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated . yeah . it was . i no <n> do not. um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um . get out of my environment . um. and uh . and that seemed to help a lot . um . and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much . um they just . they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed . um . yeah so um . yeah . <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why  . um . but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um  . keeping myself busy . um . actually um . i'm kind of. a couple days ago . i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy  . um but then i went back to . being you know going back to feeling miserable . so. um . well i realized . i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep . and um . i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky . um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me . and uh . you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that . and that made me really happy . um . yeah . thank

and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um . there's gotta be a silver lining . so . um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh . i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people . and um . and truthful and i still i still have

. so i i figured um . i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um . not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated . yeah . it was . i no <n> do not. um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um . get out of my environment . um. and uh . and that seemed to help a lot . um . and uh out here i i was i just the counselors

. so i i figured um . i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um . not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated . yeah . it was . i no <n> do not. um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um . get out of my environment . um. and uh . and that seemed to help a lot . um . and uh out here i i was i just the counselors

. yeah . <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why  . um . but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um  . keeping myself busy . um . actually um . i'm kind of. a couple days ago . i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy  . um but then i went back to . being you know going back to feeling miserable . so. um . well i realized . i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep . and um . i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky . um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me . and uh . you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that . and that made me really happy . um . yeah . thank

ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through . um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've . gotten rid of themselves a long time ago . but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um . there's gotta be a silver lining . so . um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh . i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people . and um . and truthful and i still i still have drive in me . yeah . ugh <sigh> so much um . my last marriage. um not getting out when i should have . um . and uh just. i regret a lot. <sigh>. um the any situation that would've had a red flag um . eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work. and um . no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um . i i would tell myself um to um . that it's not selfish . to let go of a bad situation . and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself . so if. had i known that then had had i known that. then i i i probably would've done better in life. so . yeah . <sigh>. um. people who um . when people are down on me for my faults . um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people

me mad . <laughter> i vent <laughter> um . yeah i tend to vent and then uh . and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um. i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore. mm. i try not to get angry um . because i have a really bad temper. and it um . and it can get outta hand so um . what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap.  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind. and

diagnosed again um in august. um . the first time it was um . i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um  . and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress . um . and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um . and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore . so i i figured um . i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um . not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated . yeah . it was . i no <n> do not. um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um . get out of my environment . um. and uh . and that seemed to help a lot . um . and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much . um they just . they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed . um . yeah so um . yeah . <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why  . um . but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um  . keeping myself busy . um . actually um . i'm kind of. a couple days ago . i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy  . um but then i went back to . being you know going back to feeling miserable . so. um . well i realized . i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep . and um . i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky . um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me . and uh . you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that . and that made me really happy . um . yeah . thank you <laughter>. oh geez. um . i've had so many years of just . just bad just a lot of bad . that it there has it's been a long time . since i've been proud of anything . i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through . um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've . gotten rid of themselves a long time ago . but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um . there's gotta be a silver lining . so . um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh . i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people . and um . and truthful and i still i still have drive in me . yeah . ugh <sigh> so much um . my last marriage. um not getting out when i should have . um . and uh just. i regret a lot. <sigh>. um the any situation that would've had a red flag um . eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work. and um . no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um . i i would tell myself um to um . that it's not selfish . to let go of a bad situation . and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself . so if. had i known that then had had i known that. then i i i probably would've done better in life. so . yeah . <sigh>. um. people who um . when people are down on me for my faults . um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um . people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy. um. just anybody who picks on the little guy . um . you know people who don't care about the environment or animals. um . i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be . and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do . and uh i that makes me mad . <laughter> i vent <laughter> um . yeah i tend to vent and then uh . and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um. i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore. mm. i try not to get angry um . because i have a really bad temper. and it um . and it can get outta hand so um . what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap.  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind. and come back to it . um . it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um . it was about um . actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her . and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um . i was i was tired um i was it was late and um . i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um . and you <yo> <sigh>. it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person  . um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue . mm kinda petty and stupid but . at the time it it seemed . it seemed uh . viable . um . hmm. one of my most memorable experiences . um . god <go> i've had so many um . maybe. it was um . i don't know. um . it was . probably um . graduating pharmacy school . um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing . uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent . and um . i uh . i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um . and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah . yeah . um . i'm reliable . um . i um . i'm talented . um i. i'm a good listener. um . i'm always there to help people . um . i tend to always try to do the right thing . um . sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but . um . and just . i uh . all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself. um . yeah . um . going to comedy shows . um . just um . having moments where you just laugh with people . um . sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood. uh . i don't know. probably that's about it . uh huh . okay . thank you . bye.",

<cough>. something that you created um develop into a you know pretty decent human being you know a decent person. that's the best thing. oh a lot of ways. um well actually. i didn't have two parents i had a mother. and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i had no contact with him um. but the thing that i do. differently than what my mother did. um. she was a strong disciplinarian. um both verbally and physically. um. and. she at she had this tendency which she outgrew. she had this tendency to be very critical okay critical and um. um opinionated <laughter> and very religious. um. and sort of. sort of looked at people who were not and that was me um as if they. were living life wrong because they were not going to church or reading

um a schizophrenic. and he had had. um he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training with a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hearing when he was four years old. um but. and then when he turned fourteen the schizophrenia came up. um so right now he he's in a supportive living environment he's twenty seven years old. um but he he he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now. i had problems in the past 'cause he didn't wanna take the medication you'd give him the medication and he'd hide it stick it in his pocket or whatever. so but he's come to terms with that and we've all have come to terms with that and he's doing he's doing pretty good. scrubbed_entry. um that son he's twenty <twen> he's twenty seven as i said 'cause he's a twin. um. um was living in texas with his wife. and um he got a promotion to um. scrubbed_entry. now he's in california too both are in california okay so. um. i

father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i had no contact with him um. but the thing that i do. differently than what my mother did. um. she was a strong disciplinarian. um both verbally and physically. um. and. she at she had this tendency which she outgrew. she had this tendency to be very critical okay critical and um. um opinionated <laughter> and very religious. um. and sort of. sort of looked at people who were not and that was me um as if they. were living life wrong because they were not going to church or reading the bible and that kind of thing. what was the other part. of the question. i i i don't get a good night's sleep or i don't sleep at all unless i take medication and that's that that's all there is to it if i don't take medication i don't sleep

because um my life had gotten so stressful. to the point where. it was either i had to do something or. or end something to tell you the truth yeah. um yes mhm. yeah i think it's useful um you know as a good sounding board. you know someone to throw. you know your concerns out and you know discuss things that may be bothering you or good things too yeah i think therapy with medication. um. since i've been going to therapy. um the changes. a lot of changes um. i've been more focused. more. hopeful. um. hm. it it's just been a good experience for me which is why i continue to go. really happy. well. i can feel really happy. um by some occurrence i can't think of anything right now just like that. and then. i go back to how i was feeling. so i can't really pinpoint anything really i mean. eh eh i mean if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time. that that makes me happy when things go right how about that. hm. mm something i did recently. that i really. something i did recently that i really enjoyed. mean really really enjoyed. recently. hm. i can't think of anything. i don't have a best friend. um my best qualities. are that. i'm a honest person. i genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt. um everyone in my book. is as they appear to be. until they prove prove it differently. um. i'm very generous. overly generous <laughter>. um. and i'm very i like to help other people. i mean help you know i'm on a personal level help people. you know with anything whatever their problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody else that's helping them out. mhm. anything i regret. how so. there's only one thing i regret and that is that. um. after my twins became um became old enough to um. start going to um school the elementary school level um. i was taking some courses um as a pre law major. and um. at that time i was married to their father. who who turned out not to be a good. fit for me. and. because of the stresses involved with him. you know knowing that that was gonna end and i was gonna leave him. um. i dropped out of college. so that was my biggest regret. hm. stay in school no matter what. stay the course no matter what. that i'm a good person. i'm a good human being. that's all. okay. goodbye.",

thank you how are you. i grew up in oklahoma. mhm. um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here. my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much. <sniffle>. oklahoma's very different um. uh l_a's a lot more exciting. there's a lot more um. uh to do here and um. uh the ocean obviously is very nice so. um. you know that's a good question i um. i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and. i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come. very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made. <laughter>. pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural. it seemed like a good fit. um i just really like it here. oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach. um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or. um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice. mm. i studied philosophy and um political theory and government. and did a little bit of english literature on the side. um it. kind of just happened naturally i think uh. i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different. areas and. i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that. um. not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities. um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often. <laughter> um. you know i have actually studied to become a success coach. um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice. aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students. um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams. um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that. um. you know it can be challenging for people to actually. be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um. undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it. uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too. um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so. um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people. i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged. and i think that um is. something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted. um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers. <laughter> pretty good i think. um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time. not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no. hmm. hmm. i'm not sure. it would've probably been a discussion over politics. and it probably would've been a friendly argument. um. probably with one of my liberal friends so. but i actually can't remember the specific time. <laughter>. <sniffle>. mm. i meditate. um i. do that almost every day. um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful. um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts. so that's nice. mm. well let me think about that for a minute. <sigh>. hmm. <laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um. just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle>. <sigh>. hmm. okay i'm sorry <laughter>. hmm. well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly. um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but. um i do have it sometimes. probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it. you know if i didn't have it. um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um. it's usually me in school somewhere. at the end of the semester. haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail. and. you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i. study and attend class the way i should have. um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating. and i'm not exactly sure. why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so. no i don't think so. um at least not not that i'm aware of. <sniffle>. i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew. and they live on the east coast. and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um. i when i used to live there when he was younger. um spent a lot of time with them and. since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so. for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back. in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them. um and that i felt bad about because. we really enjoy each other's company and he. um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back. so that's um. that makes me feel bad sometimes. mm. um. well i have a brother i'm very close to him. he's younger. and. um he's like four four and a half years younger. he's married um i have a nephew. um my both of my parents have passed away. so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them. um. on my father's side there's one brother. um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are. <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um. most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um. so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then. but you know we're not that close with our extended family so. um. i'd say well. um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences. scrubbed_entry. when i came out to california. um. i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um. it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so. um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and. um we just established this really strong friendship and. she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um. but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um. and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know. i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice. i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um. sometimes my you know. depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but. um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful. um and i can sleep. uh. you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles. so. um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination. um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night. or at least if i do i don't remember it. so. um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit. because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home. most of the time but then i travel. like one week a month. and when i travel i'll take the red-eye. um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i. um sleep. poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep. and the first day. after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay. but usually the second day is not very good. um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate. and um. i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle. i would say good. um. summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little. um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about. um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good. not really i can't i can't think of anything um. there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um. and i hike with friends and. um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated. um because i didn't really exercise when i was there. and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like. it's okay. thank you. no. no. hmm well. scrubbed_entry. he's a lot of fun and. um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and. we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and. um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun. hmm. <sigh>. well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun. but that i can be serious. and um. that i you know care about others. uh. and that i'm loyal. and. i'm not sure what else. um. i think those those are probably the main things. <sniffle>. um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so. um. i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem. uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar. i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging. um and i wish that i um. xxx. i don't know. uh. i think i wish that i was in a relationship. so. probably those things. mm. hmm. so at the last organization i used to work at. i had a boss and she was. i don't feel like she was um. i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh. used to push my buttons or so i thought. and so um. one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer. um and he was upset about something and. it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was. um. but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i. have very strong opinions about how you handle. challenges with people <peo> with staff members. and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought. um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel. um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it. and um. i did you know. i tried to be very calm and. said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but. uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there. to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me. or after we had that interaction so. <laughter>. so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this. thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had. read it back then. which is. um when you think about buying something instead of thinking. uh oh. here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it. it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that. because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it. you know. intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so. you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh. been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago. <sigh> probably. scrubbed_entry. um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them. and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them. so. <sigh> let's see. well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore. uh and i got to fly first class. um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um. tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because. um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too. sure. thank you. bye.",

thanks. i'm well thank you how are you. i grew up in oklahoma. mhm. um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here. my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much. <sniffle>. oklahoma's very different um. uh l_a's a lot more exciting. there's a lot more um. uh to do here and um. uh the ocean obviously is very nice so. um. you know that's a good question i um. i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and. i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come. very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made. <laughter>. pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural. it seemed like a good fit. um i just really like it here. oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach. um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or. um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice. mm. i studied philosophy and um political theory and government. and did a little bit of english literature on the side. um it. kind of just happened naturally i think uh. i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different. areas and. i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that. um. not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities. um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often. <laughter> um. you know i have actually studied to become a success coach. um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice. aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students. um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams. um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that. um. you know it can be challenging for people to actually. be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um. undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it. uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too. um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so. um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people. i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged. and i think that um is. something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted. um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers. <laughter> pretty good i think. um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time. not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no. hmm. hmm. i'm not sure. it would've probably been a discussion over politics. and it probably would've been a friendly argument. um. probably with one of my liberal friends so. but i actually can't remember the specific time. <laughter>. <sniffle>. mm. i meditate. um i. do that almost every day. um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful. um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts. so that's nice. mm. well let me think about that for a minute. <sigh>. hmm. <laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um. just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle>. <sigh>. hmm. okay i'm sorry <laughter>. hmm. well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly. um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but. um i do have it sometimes. probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it. you know if i didn't have it. um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um. it's usually me in school somewhere. at the end of the semester. haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail. and. you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i. study and attend class the way i should have. um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating. and i'm not exactly sure. why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so. no i don't think so. um at least not not that i'm aware of. <sniffle>. i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew. and they live on the east coast. and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um. i when i used to live there when he was younger. um spent a lot of time with them and. since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so. for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back. in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them. um and that i felt bad about because. we really enjoy each other's company and he. um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back. so that's um. that makes me feel bad sometimes. mm. um. well i have a brother i'm very close to him. he's younger. and. um he's like four four and a half years younger. he's married um i have a nephew. um my both of my parents have passed away. so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them. um. on my father's side there's one brother. um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are. <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um. most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um. so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then. but you know we're not that close with our extended family so. um. i'd say well. um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences. scrubbed_entry. when i came out to california. um. i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um. it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so. um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and. um we just established this really strong friendship and. she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um. but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um. and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know. i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice. i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um. sometimes my you know. depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but. um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful. um and i can sleep. uh. you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles. so. um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination. um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night. or at least if i do i don't remember it. so. um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit. because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home. most of the time but then i travel. like one week a month. and when i travel i'll take the red-eye. um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i. um sleep. poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep. and the first day. after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay. but usually the second day is not very good. um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate. and um. i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle. i would say good. um. summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little. um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about. um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good. not really i can't i can't think of anything um. there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um. and i hike with friends and. um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated. um because i didn't really exercise when i was there. and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like. it's okay. thank you. no. no. hmm well. scrubbed_entry. he's a lot of fun and. um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and. we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and. um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun. hmm. <sigh>. well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun. but that i can be serious. and um. that i you know care about others. uh. and that i'm loyal. and. i'm not sure what else. um. i think those those are probably the main things. <sniffle>. um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so. um. i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem. uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar. i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging. um and i wish that i um. xxx. i don't know. uh. i think i wish that i was in a relationship. so. probably those things. mm. hmm. so at the last organization i used to work at. i had a boss and she was. i don't feel like she was um. i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh. used to push my buttons or so i thought. and so um. one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer. um and he was upset about something and. it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was. um. but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i. have very strong opinions about how you handle. challenges with people <peo> with staff members. and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought. um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel. um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it. and um. i did you know. i tried to be very calm and. said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but. uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there. to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me. or after we had that interaction so. <laughter>. so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this. thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had. read it back then. which is. um when you think about buying something instead of thinking. uh oh. here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it. it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that. because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it. you know. intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so. you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh. been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago. <sigh> probably. scrubbed_entry. um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them. and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them. so. <sigh> let's see. well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore. uh and i got to fly first class. um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um. tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because. um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too. sure. thank you.

a group with more than a a couple of people. i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged. and i think that um is. something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted. um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers. <laughter> pretty good i think. um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time. not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no. hmm. hmm. i'm not sure. it would've probably been a discussion over politics. and it probably would've been a friendly argument. um. probably with one of my liberal friends so. but i actually can't remember the specific time. <laughter>. <sniffle>. mm. i meditate. um i. do that almost every day. um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful. um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts. so that's nice. mm. well let me think about that for a minute. <sigh>. hmm. <laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um. just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle>. <sigh>. hmm. okay i'm sorry <laughter>. hmm. well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly. um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but. um i do have it sometimes. probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it. you know if i didn't have it. um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um. it's usually me in school somewhere. at the end of the semester. haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail. and. you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i. study and attend class the way i should have. um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating. and i'm not exactly sure. why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so. no i don't think so. um at least not not that i'm aware of. <sniffle>. i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew. and they live on the east coast. and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um. i when i used to live there when he was younger. um spent a lot of time with them and. since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so. for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back. in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them. um and that i felt bad about because. we really enjoy each other's company and he. um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back. so that's um. that makes me feel bad sometimes. mm. um. well i have a brother i'm very close to him. he's younger. and. um he's like four four and a half years younger. he's married um i have a nephew. um my both of my parents have passed away. so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them. um. on my father's side there's one brother. um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are. <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um. most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um. so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then. but you know we're not that close with our extended family so. um. i'd say well. um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences. scrubbed_entry. when i came out to california. um. i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um. it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so. um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and. um we just established this really strong friendship and. she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um. but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um. and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know. i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice. i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um. sometimes my you know. depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but. um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful. um and i can sleep. uh. you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles. so. um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination. um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night. or at least if i do i don't remember it. so. um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit. because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home. most of the time but then i travel. like one week a month. and when i travel i'll take the red-eye. um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i. um sleep. poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep. and the first day. after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay. but usually the second day is not very good. um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate. and um. i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle. i would say good. um. summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little. um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about. um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good. not really i can't i can't think of anything um. there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um. and i hike with friends and. um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated. um because i didn't really exercise when i was there. and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like. it's okay. thank you. no. no. hmm well. scrubbed_entry. he's a lot of fun and. um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and. we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and. um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun. hmm. <sigh>. well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun. but that i can be serious. and um. that i you know care about others. uh. and that i'm loyal. and. i'm not sure what else. um. i think those those are probably the main things. <sniffle>. um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so. um. i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem. uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar. i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging. um and i wish that i um. xxx. i don't know. uh. i think i wish that i was in a relationship. so. probably those things. mm. hmm. so at the last organization i used to work at. i had a boss and she was. i don't feel like she was um. i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh. used to push my buttons or so i thought. and so um. one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer. um and he was upset about something and. it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was. um. but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i. have very strong opinions about how you handle. challenges with people <peo> with staff members. and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought. um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel. um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it. and um. i did you know. i tried to be very calm and. said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but. uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there. to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me. or after we had that interaction so. <laughter>. so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this. thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had. read it back then. which is. um when you think about buying something instead of thinking. uh oh. here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it. it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that. because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it. you know. intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so. you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh. been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago. <sigh> probably. scrubbed_entry. um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them. and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them. so. <sigh> let's see. well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore. uh and i got to fly first class. um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um. tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because. um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too. sure. thank you. bye.",

yes thanks. i'm well thank you how are you. i grew up in oklahoma. mhm. um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here. my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much. <sniffle>. oklahoma's very different um. uh l_a's a lot more exciting. there's a lot more um. uh to do here and um. uh the ocean obviously is very nice so. um. you know that's a good question i um. i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and. i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come. very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made. <laughter>. pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural. it seemed like a good fit. um i just really like it here. oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach. um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or. um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice. mm. i studied philosophy and um political theory and government. and did a little bit of english literature on the side. um it. kind of just happened naturally i think uh. i went to liberal arts school and got kind

love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um. i when i used to live there when he was younger. um spent a lot of time with them and. since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so. for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back. in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them. um and that i felt bad about because. we really enjoy each other's company and he. um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back. so that's um. that makes me feel bad sometimes. mm. um. well i have a brother i'm very close to him. he's younger. and. um he's like four four and a half years younger. he's married um i have a nephew. um my both of my parents have passed away. so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them. um. on my father's side there's one brother. um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are. <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um. most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um. so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then. but you know we're not that close with our extended family so. um. i'd say well. um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences. scrubbed_entry. when i came out to california. um. i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um. it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so. um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and. um we just established this really strong friendship and. she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um. but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um. and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know. i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice. i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um. sometimes my you know. depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but. um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful. um and i can sleep. uh. you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles. so. um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination. um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night. or at least if i do i don't remember it. so. um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit. because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home. most of the time but then i travel. like one week a month. and when i travel i'll take the red-eye. um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i. um sleep. poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep. and the first day. after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay. but usually the second day is not very good. um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate. and um. i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle. i would say good. um. summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little. um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about. um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good. not really i can't i can't think of anything um. there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um. and i hike with friends and. um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated. um because i didn't really exercise when i was there. and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like. it's okay. thank you. no. no. hmm well. scrubbed_entry. he's a lot of fun and. um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and. we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and. um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun. hmm. <sigh>. well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun. but that i can be serious. and um. that i you know care about others. uh. and that i'm loyal. and. i'm not sure what else. um. i think those those are probably the main things. <sniffle>. um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so. um. i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem. uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar. i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging. um and i wish that i um. xxx. i don't know. uh. i think i wish that i was in a relationship. so. probably those things. mm. hmm. so at the last organization i used to work at. i had a boss and she was. i don't feel like she was um. i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh. used to push my buttons or so i thought. and so um. one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer. um and he was upset about something and. it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was. um. but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i. have very strong opinions about how you handle. challenges with people <peo> with staff members. and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought. um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel. um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it. and um. i did you know. i tried to be very calm and. said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but. uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there. to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me. or after we had that interaction so. <laughter>. so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this. thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had. read it back then. which is. um when you think about buying something instead of thinking. uh oh. here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it. it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that. because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it. you know. intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so. you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh. been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago. <sigh> probably. scrubbed_entry. um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them. and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them. so. <sigh> let's see. well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore. uh and i got to fly first class. um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um. tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because. um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too. sure. thank you. bye.",

thanks. i'm well thank you how are you. i grew up in oklahoma. mhm. um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here. my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much. <sniffle>. oklahoma's very different um. uh l_a's a lot more exciting. there's a lot more um. uh to do here and um. uh the ocean obviously is very nice so. um. you know that's a good question i um. i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and. i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come. very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made. <laughter>. pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural. it seemed like a good fit. um i just really like it here. oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach. um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or. um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice. mm. i studied philosophy and um political theory and government. and did a little bit of english literature on the side. um it. kind of just happened naturally i think uh. i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different. areas and. i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that. um. not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities. um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often. <laughter> um. you know i have actually studied to become a success coach. um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice. aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students. um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams. um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that. um. you know it can be challenging for people to actually. be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um. undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it. uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too. um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so. um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people. i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged. and i think that um is. something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted. um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers. <laughter> pretty good i think. um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time. not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no. hmm. hmm. i'm not sure. it would've probably been a discussion over politics. and it probably would've been a friendly argument. um. probably with one of my liberal friends so. but i actually can't remember the specific time. <laughter>. <sniffle>. mm. i meditate. um i. do that almost every day. um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful. um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts. so that's nice. mm. well let me think about that for a minute. <sigh>. hmm. <laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um. just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle>. <sigh>. hmm. okay i'm sorry <laughter>. hmm. well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly. um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but. um i do have it sometimes. probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it. you know if i didn't have it. um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um. it's usually me in school somewhere. at the end of the semester. haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail. and. you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i. study and attend class the way i should have. um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating. and i'm not exactly sure. why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried

and that's been nice. i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um. sometimes my you know. depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but. um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful. um and i can sleep. uh. you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles. so. um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination. um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night. or at least if i do i don't remember it. so. um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit. because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home. most of the time but then i travel. like one week a month. and when i travel i'll take the red-eye. um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i. um sleep. poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep. and the first day. after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay. but usually the second day is not very good. um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate. and um. i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle. i would say good. um. summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little. um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about. um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good. not really i can't i can't think of anything um. there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um. and i hike with friends and. um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated. um because i didn't really exercise when i was there. and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like. it's okay. thank you. no. no. hmm well. scrubbed_entry. he's a lot of fun and. um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and. we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and. um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun. hmm. <sigh>. well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun. but that i can be serious. and um. that i you know care about others. uh. and that i'm loyal. and. i'm not sure what else. um. i think those those are probably the main things. <sniffle>. um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so. um. i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem. uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar. i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging. um and i wish that i um. xxx. i don't know. uh. i think i wish that i was in a relationship. so. probably those things. mm. hmm. so at the last organization i used to work at. i had a boss and she was. i don't feel like she was um. i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh. used to push my buttons or so i thought. and so um. one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer. um and he was upset about something and. it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was. um. but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i. have very strong opinions about how you handle. challenges with people <peo> with staff members. and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought. um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel. um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it. and um. i did you know. i tried to be very calm and. said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but. uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there. to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me. or after we had that interaction so. <laughter>. so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this. thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had. read it back then. which is. um when you think about buying something instead of thinking. uh oh. here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it. it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that. because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it. you know. intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so. you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh. been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago. <sigh> probably. scrubbed_entry. um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them. and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them. so. <sigh> let's see. well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore. uh and i got to fly first class. um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um. tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because. um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too. sure. thank you. bye.",

i'm well thank you how are you. i grew up in oklahoma. mhm. um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here. my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much. <sniffle>. oklahoma's very different um. uh l_a's a lot more exciting. there's a lot more um. uh to do here and um. uh the ocean obviously is very nice so. um. you know that's a good question i um. i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and. i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come. very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made. <laughter>. pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural. it seemed like a good fit. um i just really like it here. oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach. um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or. um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice. mm. i studied philosophy and um political theory and government. and did a little bit of english literature on the side. um it. kind of just happened naturally i think uh. i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different. areas and. i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that. um. not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities. um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often. <laughter> um. you know i have actually studied to become a success coach. um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice. aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students. um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams. um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that. um. you know it can be challenging for people to actually. be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um. undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it. uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too. um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so. um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people. i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged. and i think that um is. something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted. um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers. <laughter> pretty good i think. um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time. not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no. hmm. hmm. i'm not sure. it would've probably been a discussion over politics. and it probably would've been a friendly argument. um. probably with one of my liberal friends so. but i actually can't remember the specific time. <laughter>. <sniffle>. mm. i meditate. um i. do that almost every day. um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful. um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts. so that's nice. mm. well let me think about that for a minute. <sigh>. hmm. <laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um. just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle>. <sigh>. hmm. okay i'm sorry <laughter>. hmm. well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly. um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but. um i do have it sometimes. probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it. you know if i didn't have it. um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um. it's usually me in school somewhere. at the end of the semester. haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail. and. you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i. study and attend class the way i should have. um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating. and i'm not exactly sure. why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so. no i don't think so. um at least not not that i'm aware of. <sniffle>. i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew. and they live on the east coast. and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um. i when i used to live there when he was younger. um spent a lot of time with them and. since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so. for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back. in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them. um and that i felt bad about because. we really enjoy each other's company and he. um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back. so that's um. that makes me feel bad sometimes. mm. um. well i have a brother i'm very close to him. he's younger. and. um he's like four four and a half years younger. he's married um i have a nephew. um my both of my parents have passed away. so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them. um. on my father's side there's one brother. um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are. <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um. most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um. so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then. but you know we're not that close with our extended family so. um. i'd say well. um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences. scrubbed_entry. when i came out to california. um. i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um. it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so. um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and. um we just established this really strong friendship and. she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um. but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um. and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know. i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and

well i didn't know what was happening in that moment so i didn't feel. so bad at the time but i felt bad afterward because then. um. you know my mother was upset by it my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was. it was disturbing to see her. you know really disturbed that way but. at the time that it actually happened i wasn't really upset it was more the the aftermath of it. mm it was <wa> it was. <laughter>. <sigh> situation that. <sniffle>. <sigh>. i don't know um. well i can think of um there's probably a million situations that i would've <laughter> i wish i would've

the girl that i think that i should have married. so. that's a big one for me. yeah well. we <w> we were together for about four years. and uh i think i just took her for granted and i just didn't uh commit. and um. that was a long time ago and now that's it's been so many years i realize well i don't know that if it's a realization but i think now that. that yeah she should've been my wife that we were meant for each other or made for each other. but because. my selfishness and because i just uh. had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didn't uh. i didn't do what i should've done what what the smart thing would've been. <sigh>. well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was. <sigh>. no i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i've not i don't feel like i'm as as good of a friend. as i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh. how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help people anyone who who has a problem i can't. i never feel like i can help anyone. who i know who has a problem so. oh that happens every day i guess it that happens with everyone who i know and everyone. all of my relatives and all of my friends i don't. feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives you know. well they're um. it's very distant it's it's just. it's very cordial and it's very uh. uh i don't know what the word is it's on the. it's kept at a very surface level i don't think that they know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all. and uh i don't know them very well either not not in a not in a true sense. so. yeah it's it's. i think a lot of families are that way but it it is. it does bother me that mine is that way. oh it's very easy i sleep a lot and i um. yeah i i i have no problem sleeping at all. no not not really i would say. they way i am now it's the way i think i've been my whole life so. even when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and. no i don't think i've i've changed much. mm pretty down. but like i said. in a way i could say yeah i'm feeling really down but then again. i've always been this way so. it's hard to say that's it's down when it's consistently that way. yes. a long. oh a long time ago i was um. about ten years old or. around there about. uh i was just missing a lot of school. i didn't wanna go to school so eventually uh they sent me to. to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh. it went from there. no i haven't gone to therapy. since i was a teenager. well. i didn't feel it was helping me at all. so. one day i just. decided i didn't wanna go anymore. eh. uh well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me um. so i guess it i don't know that it affected me much. no i wouldn't say. disturbing. no. mm. well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew. and uh i have a. my best friend's children are i feel like they're my my nephew and my niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them. uh my ideal weekend would be um. i would travel <tr> i would probably be traveling i i would. really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend um. eh going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city. uh just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you go to different places and. how they interact with you and how they see the world. different food. um. and i also like historical places i i'm into history and i and i enjoy um just visiting anywhere that has some sort of a. historical significance. <laughter>. oh i haven't taken a trip in a long time um. the last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a wedding. and i had a really good time there and i had always wanted to go to paris and so i got to go to paris and then i went to a little town. um. that's a few hours away from paris where the actual wedding was. and yeah it was really fun i think the the church where the wedding was was uh like a thousand years old so. yeah it was a really cool trip. <sigh>. <sigh> like i don't know i don't <laughter> i don't know what's what would would be considered memorable. uh. a memorable experience. probably the most memorable experience i guess would just be. nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now. that we should've. gotten married. um. that's something that stays in my memory that's why i'm saying it's memorable because. it's it's still with me and um. eh it's something that i don't think you know well i'll know i'll never forget it but it's not any. mm particular day or any particular moment you know. oh a lot um. wish i could be healthier. for one thing uh more energetic. and um. more friendly well no i think i am pretty friendly. but more uh more outgoing more social <s> more uh more social. um those two things mainly i guess i would like to be more more social more enthusiastic and more. and healthier. oh that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me i think. i think he would say that i'm. a very <sigh> well it sounds cheesy but it <laughter> he would probably say that i'm a very spiritual person. and that i'm very giving i i think i'm a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that i'm not selfish. um. and probably he would say that i'm creative also. <sigh> wow. well my advice to to myself. i don't understand the question <laughter>. yeah but we already talked about it. <sigh>. nah i can't uh well i don't think that i really believe in in being proud or in in pride. um i don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i can't really think of. any accomplishment. anyway even if i did have something <laughter> to be proud of no i can't think of anything <anythi> any sort of accomplishment i've had. <sigh>. uh something i did recently that i really enjoyed. well i sang karaoke with a couple of friends of mine. <laughter> and i don't usually do that but. yeah i had a that was a lot of fun a few days ago.

not that i can't help people anyone who who has a problem i can't. i never feel like i can help anyone. who i know who has a problem so. oh that happens every day i guess it that happens with everyone who i know and everyone. all of my relatives and all of my friends i don't. feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives you know. well they're um. it's very distant it's it's just. it's very cordial and it's very uh. uh i don't know what the word is it's on the. it's kept at a very surface level i don't think that they know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all. and uh i don't know them very well either not not in a not in a true sense. so. yeah it's it's. i think a lot of families are that way but it it is. it does bother me that mine is that way. oh it's very easy i sleep a lot and i um. yeah i i i have no problem sleeping at all. no not not really i would say. they way i am now it's the way i think i've been my whole life so. even when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and. no i don't think i've i've changed much. mm pretty down. but like i said. in a way i could say yeah i'm feeling really down but then again. i've always been this way so. it's hard to say that's it's down when it's consistently that way. yes. a long. oh a long time ago i was um. about ten years old or. around there about. uh i was just missing a lot of school. i didn't wanna go to school so eventually uh they sent me to. to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh. it went from there. no i haven't gone to therapy. since i was a teenager. well. i didn't feel it was helping me at all. so. one day i just. decided i didn't wanna go anymore. eh. uh well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me um. so i guess it i don't know that it affected me much. no i wouldn't say. disturbing. no. mm. well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew. and uh i have a. my best friend's children are i feel like they're my my nephew and my niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them. uh my ideal weekend would be um. i would travel <tr> i would probably be traveling i i would. really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend um. eh going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city. uh just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you go to different places and. how they interact with you and how they see the world. different food. um. and i also like historical places i i'm into history and i and i enjoy um just visiting anywhere that has some sort of a. historical significance. <laughter>. oh i haven't taken a trip in a long time um. the last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a

<laughter> i don't know what's what would would be considered memorable. uh. a memorable experience. probably the most memorable experience i guess would just be. nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now. that we should've. gotten married. um. that's something that stays in my memory that's why i'm saying it's memorable because. it's it's still with me and um. eh it's something that i don't think you know well i'll know i'll never forget it but it's not any. mm particular day or any particular moment you know. oh a lot um. wish i could be healthier. for one thing uh more energetic. and um. more friendly well no i think i am pretty friendly. but more uh more outgoing more social <s> more uh more social. um those two things

say that i'm. a very <sigh> well it sounds cheesy but it <laughter> he would probably say that i'm a very spiritual person. and that i'm very giving i i think i'm a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that i'm not selfish. um. and probably he would say that i'm creative also. <sigh> wow. well my advice to to myself. i don't understand the question <laughter>. yeah but we already talked about it. <sigh>. nah i can't uh well i don't think that i really believe in in being proud or in in pride. um i don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i can't really think of. any accomplishment. anyway even if i did have something <laughter> to be proud of no i can't think of anything <anythi> any sort of accomplishment i've had. <sigh>. uh something i did recently that i really enjoyed. well i sang karaoke with a couple of friends of mine. <laughter> and i don't usually do that but. yeah i had a that was a lot of fun a few days ago.

commit. and um. that was a long time ago and now that's it's been so many years i realize well i don't know that if it's a realization but i think now that. that yeah she should've been my wife that we were meant for each other or made for each other. but because. my selfishness and because i just uh. had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didn't uh. i didn't do what i should've done what what the smart thing would've been. <sigh>. well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was. <sigh>. no i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i've not i don't feel like i'm as as good of a friend. as i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh. how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help people anyone who who has a problem i can't. i never feel like i can help anyone. who i know who has a problem so. oh that happens every day i guess it that happens with everyone who i know and everyone. all of my relatives and all of my friends i don't. feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives you know. well they're um. it's very distant it's it's just. it's very cordial and it's very uh. uh i don't know what the word is it's on the. it's kept at a very surface level i don't think that they know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all. and uh i don't know them very well either not not in a not in a true sense. so. yeah it's it's. i think a lot of families are that way but it it is. it does bother me that mine is that way. oh it's very easy i sleep a lot and i um. yeah i i i have no problem sleeping at all. no not not really i would say. they way i am now it's the way i think i've been my whole life so. even when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and. no i don't think i've i've changed much. mm pretty down. but like i said. in a way i could say yeah i'm feeling really down but then again. i've always been this way so. it's hard to say that's it's down when it's consistently that way. yes. a long. oh a long time ago i was um. about ten years old or. around there about. uh i was just missing a lot of school. i didn't wanna go to school so eventually uh they sent me to. to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh. it went from there. no i haven't gone to therapy. since i was a teenager. well. i didn't feel it was helping me at all. so. one day i just. decided i didn't wanna go anymore. eh. uh well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me um. so i guess it i don't know that it affected me much. no i wouldn't say. disturbing. no. mm. well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew. and uh i have a. my best friend's children are i feel like they're my my nephew and my niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them. uh my ideal weekend would be um. i would travel <tr> i would probably be traveling i i would. really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend um. eh going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city. uh just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you go to different places and. how they interact with you and how they see the world. different food. um. and i also like historical places i i'm into history and i and i enjoy um just visiting anywhere that has some sort of a. historical significance. <laughter>. oh i haven't taken a trip in a long time um. the last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a wedding. and i had a really good time there and i had always wanted to go to paris and so i got to go to paris and then i went to a little town. um. that's a few hours away from paris where the actual wedding was. and yeah it was really fun i think the the church where the wedding was was uh like a thousand years old so. yeah it was a really cool trip. <sigh>. <sigh> like i don't know i don't <laughter> i don't know what's what would would be considered memorable. uh. a memorable experience. probably the most memorable experience i guess would just be. nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now. that we should've. gotten married. um. that's something that stays in my memory that's why i'm saying it's memorable because. it's it's still with me and um. eh it's something that i don't think you know well i'll know i'll never forget it but it's not any. mm particular day or any particular moment you know. oh a lot um. wish i could be healthier. for one thing uh more energetic. and um. more friendly well no i think i am pretty friendly. but more uh more outgoing more social <s> more uh more social. um those two things mainly i guess i would like to be more more social more enthusiastic and more. and healthier. oh that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me i think. i think he would say that i'm. a very <sigh> well it sounds cheesy but it <laughter> he would probably say that i'm a very spiritual person. and that i'm very giving i i think i'm a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that i'm not selfish. um. and probably he would say that i'm creative also. <sigh> wow. well my advice to to myself. i don't understand the question <laughter>. yeah but we already talked about it. <sigh>. nah i can't uh well i don't think that i really believe in in being proud or in in pride. um i don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i can't really think of. any accomplishment. anyway even if i did have something <laughter> to be proud of no i can't think of anything <anythi> any sort of accomplishment i've had. <sigh>. uh something i did recently that i really enjoyed. well i sang karaoke with a couple of friends of mine. <laughter> and i don't usually do that but. yeah i had a that was a lot of fun a few days ago.
